      content="Before the Ronin barged into the scene, the territory of neo-retro motorcycles was rather uncharted for TVS. In terms of racing pedigree and motorsports, TVS has earned every bragging right there is but this unexplored territory was proving to be so fertile for other manufacturers like Royal Enfield, the thinktanks at TVS had to pull off something unique."

            Before the Ronin barged into the scene, the territory of neo-retro
            motorcycles was rather uncharted for TVS. In terms of racing
            pedigree and motorsports, TVS has earned every bragging right there
            is but this unexplored territory was proving to be so fertile for
            other manufacturers like Royal Enfield, the thinktanks at TVS had to
            pull off something unique. Something &lsquo;unscripted&rsquo;. And
            that&rsquo;s where the Ronin comes in. By this time, you might
            already know that Ronin is a fancy name for a Japanese samurai with
            no master and when you think in that way, the Ronin justifies its
            moniker to some extent. It doesn&rsquo;t cater to one individual
            genre of motorcycles and thus, it has no master. History suggests
            that not every rebel or maverick has tasted success but what about
            the TVS Ronin? Is it a masterstroke by TVS to snatch the pie away
            from the oligarchs of neo-retro genre or just a marketing debacle?
          </p>
          <h3>
            <strong>Unscripted Aesthetics</strong>
          </h3>
          <p>
            Ronin&rsquo;s tagline &lsquo;Unscripted&rsquo; makes the most sense
            when it comes to its aesthetics. Kids, this is what happens when you
            try too many things at once &ndash; you fail to excel in any one of
            them. The Ronin is essentially a premium lifestyle product and that
            shows but when you start factoring in the conventional notions of
            automotive design philosophies, it struggles to prove its point. It
            tries to be a cruiser, a scrambler and a neo-retro
            motorcycle&hellip; all at once! However, there are many visual
            elements that add to its premium appeal.&nbsp;Over the past few days
            that I&rsquo;ve spent with the Ronin, I&rsquo;ve really come to
            admire how it looks from up front. The T-shaped DRLs might not have
            any significance but they make the Ronin quite distinctive and
            instantly recognizable. Then there&rsquo;s the meaty 110-section
            block-pattern rubber that works in tandem with the lustrous golden
            USD forks to make it look beefy. The 14-litre fuel tank looks
            muscular and plays the role of making the Ronin look like a cruiser
            motorcycle.&nbsp;Things start getting a bit awkward as you slowly
            pan your eyes towards the rear section. The boxy side panels and the
            unnecessarily curvy rear fender don&rsquo;t gel well with the rest
            of the motorcycle and further establish the fact that not all curves
            are pleasing to the eyes. Especially when they look artificially
            bulbous. Still talking about the motorcycle, peeps. I
            swear!&nbsp;The Ronin might be suffering from an identity crisis,
            but it still manages to look and &lsquo;feel&rsquo; premium. We have
            come to expect good build quality from TVS and since Ronin is being
            pitched as a premium product, it doesn&rsquo;t disappoint in that
            regard. Be it nifty touches like the mirror stalks or the levers for
            that matter, everything reminds you that special attention has been
            paid while developing the Ronin.
          </p>
          <h3>
            <strong>A thumper&hellip; from TVS&hellip; wait what?</strong>
          </h3>
          <p>
            Its cruiser credentials are further highlighted right after you
            bring the Ronin to life as its exhaust lets out a deep growl,
            reminiscent of small-capacity thumpers. Instead of developing an
            entirely new powertrain, TVS borrowed Apache 200&rsquo;s mill and
            tweaked it slightly to meet Ronin&rsquo;s characteristics. The end
            product is a 225.9cc, four-valve, single-cylinder engine that puts
            out 20.4hp at 7,750rpm and 19.93Nm of torque at 3,750rpm.&nbsp;As
            compared to the Apache 200, this engine features identical bore and
            stroke dimensions of 66mm. This squared-out architecture makes the
            Ronin a bit livelier in the low and mid-range as compared to the
            Apache 200.&nbsp;The clutch mechanicals include slip and assist
            function as well, translating into light clutch action which makes
            this samurai a perfect urban warrior. The Ronin rolls off quite
            spiritedly as soon as you dump the clutch and get going. The oomph
            available low down in the rev range makes the Ronin a very tractable
            and easy motorcycle. Vibrations are kept at bay for the most part,
            but they start making their presence felt as you make your way
            higher up in the rev range. It is no tarmac scorcher, and the spread
            of performance reflects this fact as the Ronin starts losing some
            breath after crossing the 100kmph mark.&nbsp;The gear ratios of the
            Ronin aren&rsquo;t that spaced out, meaning that there&rsquo;s
            always oodles of pull available at your disposal, irrespective of
            the gear you&rsquo;re in. Light clutch action, good low-end
            performance and the overall tractability of the engine made my
            commutes rather easy-going and fun most of the time. However, when
            the roads open up and the horizon starts appearing ahead, the Ronin
            starts feeling a bit stressed-out. The Ronin is meant for laidback
            riding and don&rsquo;t get us wrong. The Ronin is a potent tourer
            but only if you aren&rsquo;t clocking license-revoking speeds.
          </p>
          <h3>
            <strong>Laidback&hellip; not lazy!&nbsp;</strong>
          </h3>
          <p>
            Cruiser credentials like relaxed rake angle, comfortable ergonomics
            and slightly rearset footpegs will have you believe that the Ronin
            changes directions like a freight train. But thankfully, that
            isn&rsquo;t the case. We have to also factor in the fact that
            TVS&rsquo; army of mechanical maestros have made the company a
            formidable force in the Indian motorsport scenario. The reason why
            their road-going bikes handle beautifully and the Ronin isn&rsquo;t
            very different either. The steering is very reactive to inputs and
            the overall light weight of the motorcycle also assists in making
            the Ronin a very easy and intuitive motorcycle to live with.&nbsp;In
            the urban confinments, the Ronin shines because of how approachable
            it&rsquo;s. The seat height is nice and low and the riding
            ergonomics are so sorted that you won&rsquo;t be hurling curses
            every now and then. Be it crawling through Mumbai&rsquo;s infamous
            clogged routes or splitting lanes like a bloodthirsty maniac, the
            Ronin does it all with composure. The swanky golden USD forks are
            sourced from Showa and that SHOWs! &nbsp;The general consensus
            regarding USD forks is that they&rsquo;re destined to be stiff but
            the Ronin is a prime example why this notion is anything but a
            widespread hoax. It all boils down to how you tune the internals and
            the Ronin comes out as an absolute winner in this department.
            Despite being quick on its feet, it never unsettles on harsh
            surfaces and lets you know that you&rsquo;re riding something
            premium, and you deserve to be treated that way. The compromise
            between ride quality and agility is downright commendable.
            I&rsquo;ll just leave it here.&nbsp;There&rsquo;s nothing to write
            home about when it comes to Ronin&rsquo;s braking because the
            equipment does the job just fine. The front brake has good initial
            bite, and the feedback is pronounced as well but in emergency
            situations, I found myself pulling the lever a little more than I
            would like in hairy situations. Good braking performance is further
            assisted by the dual-purpose tyres. At the first glance, they might
            not look like the grippiest hoops but their performance considering
            their purpose, was more than what we could have asked for! On dry
            tarmac, they perform well according to the performance Ronin packs
            and they continue to perform well, paying no heed to the road
            conditions.

            Ditching symmetry for offset instrument cluster has worked aesthetic
            wonders for motorcycles like the Ducati Scrambler and that can be
            said for the Ronin as well. The LCD dash comes loaded with
            information and TVS&rsquo; SmartXConnect bluetooth
            tech.&nbsp;Regular readouts include the likes of distance-to-empty
            readout, gear shift assist and indicator, side stand indicator with
            engine cut-off function, hazard lights, twin tripmeters, service due
            indicator along with other run-of-the-mill info.&nbsp;TVS&rsquo; GTT
            (glide through technology) also makes its presence felt here, adding
            another arrow in Ronin&rsquo;s quiver as it hunts down urban
            elements. This low-rpm assist technology makes life easier when the
            vehicles are barely moving. Other notable features include Rain and
            Urban ABS modes that tweak the ABS&rsquo; sensitivity, assist and
            slipper clutch and adjustable levers (reserved for top spec).

            The TVS Ronin might be a little amused by its own appearance, but it
            does know what it&rsquo;s: a &lsquo;good&rsquo; motorcycle with no
            major flaws apart from a visual identity crisis. It looks (from
            certain angles) and feels (from all the angles) premium, and not to
            forget, different as well.&nbsp;The Ronin turned out to be a
            brilliant commuter and an able tourer, something which the targeted
            set of audience is currently demanding from their potential garage
            queens. If you can ignore the gaudy looks, the Ronin will definitely
            impress you with its easygoing nature.
