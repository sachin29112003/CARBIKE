            There have been times when a manufacturer has steered the course of
            Indian motorcycling single-handedly. It majorly happens piggybacking
            on new technology or a new approach towards motorcycling. We saw the
            latter happening with the Bajaj Pulsar brand which introduced the
            Indian youngsters to the thrill of speed. To this day, the NS400Z
            has filled those big-foot sized shoes with its explosive
            performance-to-price quotient. And now, Bajaj is aiming to
            revolutionize the way India commutes. Quite a big ordeal if you take
            in consideration the sheer numbers of commuters that trundle down
            our streets. However, it could happen because we have ridden the
            Freedom CNG and it packs serious potential. Oh, and did we tell you
            it is the world&rsquo;s first CNG-powered motorcycle? You already
            know it by now but we still puff up our chest with pride saying that
            again and again. Cheap thrills? Umm, isn&rsquo;t that the Freedom
            CNG all about?
          </p>
          <p>
            As I was riding the Bajaj Freedom back to Mumbai right after the
            launch, the valves of my heart got blocked with overflowing pride. I
            was riding the world&rsquo;s first CNG motorcycle and even the rest
            of the world followed suit, joining me in this quaint celebration.
            If you think superbikes are attention magnets, try pulling up on the
            Freedom while it is still a novel sight on the road. Never in my 5
            years of reviewing motorcycles was I bombarded with so many
            questions! Hence, I have curated the most asked and the most
            relevant ones to answer here. A new format? Isn&rsquo;t that what
            Freedom deserves?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Q</strong>. <strong>Is</strong> <strong>it</strong>
            <strong>safe?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            If I had a pretty penny for everytime I was asked this one question,
            yours truly would have become the richest man in the town. The
            Freedom might be Bajaj&rsquo;s first foray into making a CNG
            two-wheeler but they aren&#39;t entirely new to the ordeal of
            plonking in a CNG tank in a vehicle as they have been making CNG
            auto rickshaws since long. They aren&rsquo;t a new EV startup
            either, prone to their vehicles blowing up. The Freedom has
            undergone as many as 11 rigorous tests including some major ones
            like front, rear and side collision impact, truck rollover and drop
            tests. The result? The CNG tank that is fitted under the seat, right
            beneath the precious jewels, stayed intact without any leak or
            damage. It is safe to say after watching those videos that the
            Freedom is indeed a safe motorcycle and it wouldn&rsquo;t blow up
            between your legs. You shouldn&rsquo;t worry about the legacy of
            your namesake.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Q</strong>. <strong>Real</strong> <strong>world</strong>
            <strong>range</strong>?
          </p>
          <p>
            The Freedom isn&rsquo;t a pure-CNG motorcycle because apart from the
            2kg CNG tank that itself weighs around 18kgs once filled up to the
            brim, the Freedom can also hold two litres of fuel. Bajaj claims
            that the Freedom would run 110 kms on 1 kg of CNG while around 60
            kilometres on 1 litre of fuel. The claimed combined range stands at
            around 330 kms but in the real world if you ride it safely, the way
            it is supposed to be ridden, the Freedom will bless you with more
            range. During our rigorous test where the Freedom was enslaved to
            high revs, it still returned 126 kms on 1 kg of CNG. Do the math. We
            wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if returns figures close to 400
            kilometres, combined.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Q</strong>. <strong>Is</strong> <strong>there</strong>
            <strong>any</strong> <strong>performance</strong>
            <strong>drop</strong> <strong>in</strong> <strong>the</strong>
            <strong>CNG</strong> <strong>mode</strong>?
          </p>
          <p>
            There&rsquo;s a neat toggle switch on the left side of the
            switchgear which lets the rider switch between CNG and petrol mode.
            The Freedom derives its performance from a 125cc engine that puts
            down 9.5PS and 9.7NM. Nothing extraordinary but just enough horses
            to ride around town. One has to understand that it is not a CNG car
            where the performance drop is more substantial because here, the
            ponies killed in the process are much less. This engine is a proper
            commuter with linearity ruling the theme here. However, to reek out
            some pace out of this engine, you would need to rev it out. Pull its
            ears and let it sing. That being said, you wouldn&rsquo;t feel any
            lack of performance in day to day runabouts. It is on the highway
            that the Freedom feels a little out of place, struggling a little to
            breeze past the 100 kmph mark. The best that I saw on the
            speedometer was 108kmph in the petrol mode and 100kmph in CNG mode.
            The petrol mode does feel a bit gruntier than the CNG but not
            substantially so. If you need to attempt a quick overtake, you
            don&rsquo;t necessarily need to shift into Petrol mode and then do
            it. A simple downshift in the CNG mode would do the job. Moreover,
            you wouldn&#39;t mind fiddling with the gears as the clutch action
            is light and the transmission is smooth and precise.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Q</strong>. <strong>Are</strong> <strong>there</strong>
            <strong>any</strong> <strong>vibrations</strong>?
          </p>
          <p>
            If the Honda Shine is the epitome of engine refinement in this
            class, the Freedom comes very close to that. We were utterly
            surprised by the refinement levels displayed by the Freedom. It is a
            smooth, vibe free affair till 80kmph and even after that,
            there&rsquo;s just a minor buzz on the footpegs reminding you that
            this is a humble commuter, not an inter-continental ballistic
            tourer.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Q</strong>. <strong>How</strong> <strong>much</strong>
            <strong>time</strong> <strong>does</strong> <strong>it</strong>
            <strong>take</strong> <strong>to</strong> <strong>fill</strong>
            <strong>up</strong> <strong>CNG</strong>?
          </p>
          <p>
            This has been one of the major concerns surrounding the Bajaj
            Freedom but in the real world, it didn&rsquo;t take us more than 5
            minutes to arrive at the pump, fill CNG and take off again. Even
            during the second instance, the timing remained the same. Partly
            because there was less queue comparatively and the pump staff was
            kind (read curious) enough to let me skip the queue. But even if
            that weren&rsquo;t the case, one cannot expect to spend more than 10
            minutes in the whole process. They are CNG filling pumps after all,
            not refineries.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Q</strong>. <strong>How</strong> <strong>does</strong>
            <strong>it</strong> <strong>look</strong>?
          </p>
          <p>
            It looks and feels more premium than the motorcycles it is primarily
            targeted at: Hero&rsquo;s Super Splendor and Honda Shine. The
            Freedom has some MX inspired elements like the handlebar brace, long
            rally-inspired seat which measures 785mm (longest in the segment!)
            and dual-purpose tyres. There are some other elements too that help
            it stand apart from the sea of commuters like fork covers, tube-type
            elements snaking around the headlamp, fuel tank extensions and the
            exposed trellis frame. Even when it comes to the body panels and the
            switchgear quality, it feels like it is carrying a TVS badge on the
            tank. Bajaj has been riddled with quality related remarks but the
            Freedom, hopefully, wouldn&rsquo;t attract unauthorized quality
            control personnel. It also has a rather unique stance, thanks to the
            utilization of a smaller 16-inch wheels at the back.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Q</strong>. <strong>Is</strong> <strong>it</strong>
            <strong>comfortable</strong>?
          </p>
          <p>
            Exposing the Freedom to the infamous Mumbai streets under heavy
            spells of rain highlighted one thing: its sublime ride quality.
            Commuters should be comfortable, enabling the rider to spend long,
            tiring hours on the saddle and the Freedom does a stellar job of it.
            Not on one occasion did it feel uncomfortable or stiffly sprung. Up
            front, it gets basic telescopic forks while at the back,
            there&rsquo;s a linked monoshock weaving magic spells. The Freedom
            ate every pothole we threw at it and left no crumbs. The comfortable
            rider&rsquo;s triangle also enabled us to sail ahead instead of
            dropping anchors now and then.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Q</strong>. <strong>How</strong> <strong>does</strong>
            <strong>it</strong> <strong>handle</strong>?
          </p>
          <p>
            Having ridden the Freedom on various terrains in varying situations,
            the confidence that it inspired in us, was surprising. It is blessed
            with riding dynamics that mimic the experience of a more premium
            motorcycle. Part of this has to be credited to the use of trellis
            frame here, the same wizardry that we have seen in more expensive,
            performance-oriented motorcycles like the KTM Duke series. Even
            while riding in the wet, the Freedom maintained its composure. Cold
            feet? The Freedom wouldn&rsquo;t get it because of the confidence
            that it has on its underpinnings. It might miss out on ABS but the
            240mm front disc and 130mm drum brake have enough potency to stop
            the Freedom when it is required to.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Q</strong>. <strong>How</strong> <strong>about</strong>
            <strong>the</strong> <strong>features</strong>?
          </p>
          <p>
            According to the pricing that it has been launched at and the
            technology that it brings to the market, the Freedom is packed with
            decent features. The top-spec and the mid-spec variants get LED
            headlamp at the front and a negative LCD instrument cluster with
            Bluetooth connectivity. The base variant not only misses out on disc
            brakes but has to do with a halogen lamp at the front and a basic
            LCD instrument cluster without BT connectivity. Call it nitpicking
            but we deerly missed the presence of a kill switch and a petrol
            indicator. The thing is, Bajaj wants us to use the Freedom as a pure
            CNG motorcycle, the reason why they&#39;ve referred to the Petrol
            mode as limp home mode. So that people resort to using petrol only
            when they&rsquo;ve run out of CNG.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Q</strong>. <strong>How</strong> <strong>much</strong>
            <strong>impact</strong> <strong>is</strong> <strong>it</strong>
            <strong>going</strong> <strong>to</strong> <strong>have</strong>
            <strong>on</strong> <strong>day</strong>-<strong>to</strong>-<strong
              >day</strong
            >
            <strong>costs</strong>?
          </p>
          <p>
            If you cover 350 kilometres on a 125cc commuter motorcycle, the
            overall running cost would come down to INR 600-650. However, if you
            cover similar routine on the Freedom, it is going to cost around INR
            350-400. These calculations have been made keeping the petrol and
            CNG rates of Mumbai in mind. Bajaj is claiming that over the course
            of 5 years of owning the Freedom, it is going to save INR 75,000.
            Impressive, eh?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Q</strong>. <strong>Where</strong> <strong>can</strong>
            <strong>we</strong> <strong>book</strong> <strong>and</strong>
            <strong>what&rsquo;s</strong> <strong>the</strong>
            <strong>price</strong>?
          </p>
          <p>
            The Freedom can be had in three variants: base (INR 95,000),
            mid-spec (INR 105,000 price in India) and the top-spec with all the
            bells and whistles (INR 110,000). For now, Bajaj Auto is only
            offering the Freedom in Maharashtra and Gujarat but soon, it will be
            available in the entire country in a phase manner. If you wish to be
            a part of this revolution, you can book the Freedom at Bajaj website
            or at your nearest dealership.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>The</strong> <strong>final</strong> <strong>words</strong>?
          </p>
          <p>
            The Bajaj Freedom is aiming to fuel a revolution that it itself is
            aiming to ignite. By the looks of it, it will succeed. Naysayers and
            self-proclaimed critics might have put the Freedom in the dock but
            it has enough cred under its belt to deal with every accusation. It
            will do so while looking handsome, being feature-packed and managing
            everything with a sweet smile on its face. It is a seriously potent
            motorcycle, one that can also be tagged as one of the most important
            chapters in the Indian motorcycling history. That&#39;s a big ordeal
            and the Freedom deserves every bit of it.&nbsp;
