            You&rsquo;re allowed to look down on me for admitting that before
            riding the MT-03, I had never experienced Yamaha&rsquo;s famed 321cc
            parallel-twin screamer. Having missed out on the opportunity to ride
            both the R3 and MT-03 during its explosive and scenic first ride in
            Thailand and at our very own BIC, my right hand was tingling to rev
            the ceilings out of this screecher. Now that we can officially scoff
            at their Indian pricing, honestly, I couldn&rsquo;t care less. I had
            a week with the MT-03 and I wasn&rsquo;t even required to break my
            bank and a few bones to live that experience. Why would I care about
            the pricing? I got its sticker price printed, rolled some tobacco in
            it and smoked it off. That certainly helped.
          </p>
          <p>
            And kids, that was just a metaphor, please take good care of your
            lungs.

          <h2>
            <strong>Solid</strong>, <strong>not</strong>
            <strong>special</strong>
          </h2>
          <p>
            The MT-03 is a sleeper motorcycle because of the way it looks. It
            doesn&rsquo;t look and feel substantial but here&rsquo;s the thing:
            from some angles, it does. Take the rear three-quarters for
            instance, which, according to me, is one of the sexiest angles to
            ogle at the MT. Its headlamp cluster is largely similar to the MT-15
            and hence, the sleeper tag. For a layman, it might come across as a
            slightly modified MT-15. Until, the layman hears the twin-cylinder
            burble but we will come to that later. The entire MT range is now
            designed in such a way that they look like an extra-terrestrial
            family forgot its way and crash landed on earth. The MT-03 is no
            different. Although I wish it looked a bit different head on as
            compared to the MT-15, the MT-03 still manages to look bulkier than
            the MT-15. It all comes down to the broad tank shrouds which also
            house neat air intakes. I also like the little spoilers that flank
            the headlamp unit.

            In a typical Yamaha fashion, there&rsquo;s no room for complaint
            when it comes to the build quality. This is the bright side of Japan
            and the MT-03 embraces it with open arms with its solid feel. It
            might feel like it will stand the test of time but it doesn&rsquo;t
            feel special. That&rsquo;s where its problem lies. Until and unless
            you don&rsquo;t fire up the engine and wring its neck, the MT-03
            feels basic in terms of looks and feels. The switchgear quality is
            decent but again, it doesn&rsquo;t feel like Yamaha engineers had
            attention to detail in mind. This is where Japanese products differ
            from their European counterparts. Moreover, the placement of the
            horn switch takes some time getting used to but it still isn&rsquo;t
            as nightmarish as the one found on the MT-15. Does the MT-03 feels
            special from the rider&rsquo;s cockpit view? Certainly not. Blame
            the barebones LCD instrument cluster for it, which is devoid of any
            fancy gizmos. The MT-03 feels solid and simple, not cheap and
            complex. Personally, I can get used to it, especially after
            embracing the dark side of Japan with the MT-03.

          <h2>
            <strong>Master</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>Torque</strong>?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Not really Master of Torque, that&rsquo;s what the MT moniker stands
            for. It might hold true for its bigger, wilder siblings like the
            MT-07 and MT-09 but with mere 29NM on tap, the MT-03 certainly
            isn&rsquo;t Master of Torque. Especially when the said torque is
            delivered at a peaky 9,000rpm! Am I discrediting the engine? Hang me
            to death if I ever will because readers, this is one of the best
            engines I&rsquo;ve ever experienced. So much so that the entire ride
            experience revolves around wringing the MT-03, making it scream and
            slay and then repeat the whole ordeal again in the next gear. Oh I
            could do it the entire day, everyday, for the rest of my life!
          </p>
          <p>
            It doesn&rsquo;t necessarily translate to the fact that the MT-03
            struggles at lower revs because it behaves like a little puppy doing
            slow speeds. A gentle one at that. It just trundles along without
            showing any signs of protest. The refinement also adding to the
            experience but, once the needle crosses 6000rpm mark, the MT-03
            wakes up from a deep slumber. It growls a little at first, letting
            you know that it is now time to let people know that it isn&rsquo;t
            a modified MT-15. After 9000rpm, things become serious, loud
            and&hellip; a lot of fun because the MT-03 pulls hard! Its true
            character lies in the upper echelon of the rev range as it barks
            loudly, sprints and lunges ahead with so much vigour and then hits
            its 12,000rpm redline. The MT turns back and asks: ready for the
            carnage again? And then we go into another gear&hellip; then
            another.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although I believe for a naked streetfighter, the MT-03 could have
            used a punchier mid range. It doesn&rsquo;t fall flat but it only
            excites after crossing 7,000rpm mark. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind
            sacrificing a bit of the top end rush for some more mid range grunt
            because the MT is going to spend most of its life in the city.
            Traffic signal sprints were although fun, required me to be a lot
            more generous with the revs. That being said, the ride experience is
            intoxicating to say the least. The MT feels mechanical but in a good
            way, devoid of any fancy things. It is all about the ride and it
            shows because other important bits like gear shifts and exhaust note
            are something which make the overall ride experience a lot better!
            The MT-03 misses out on assist and slipper clutch though, absence of
            which, is felt during commutes because the clutch does feel heavy.
            But connected, oh so connected! And then there&rsquo;s the bark of
            the exhaust. At lower revs, it burbles. Give it some beans and it
            accompanies the engine induction noise with some pops and crackles.
            With all the time that I had with the MT, I made sure to keep it
            singing because it turned out to be such a rewarding experience to
            all the senses!
          </p>
          <h2>
            <strong>Master</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>Turns</strong>
          </h2>
          <p>
            Out on the straights, that lovely engine bowled me over but then the
            euphoria kicked in once I showed the MT some bends. Despite having
            basic cycle parts and underpinnings, the Japanese engineers do know
            how to instill some magic. Up front, the updated MT received a set
            of Kayaba sourced USD forks and at the back, regular monoshock does
            the job. No adjustable suspension, no fancy frame but boy, can the
            MT lean! It has a reactive front end, reacting to every little input
            you give to the handlebar. It imparts so much confidence that you
            can hang off more and more, registering greater lean angles as you
            carve your way through the canyons. While the handling is
            impressive, the ride quality leaves no room for complaint either.
            What also assists the MT in its handling prowess is how perfectly
            the rider can lock his knees on the fuel tank. Since it&rsquo;s wide
            and has nice scoops, it is fairly easy to hang off the motorcycle.
            The dimensions are slightly compact though and people with more
            physical real estate might find the MT a little cramped.
          </p>
          <p>
            It ticks all the right boxes when it comes to ergonomics because
            being a naked streetfighter, the MT gets a wide handlebar and
            slightly rearset footpegs. No surprises here as it should be. It
            becomes very evident how much Yamaha has focused on the overall ride
            experience and how the MT communicates with the rider. It is
            phenomenal. What needs some work is the braking department because
            the front brake although progressive, lacks that initial bite which
            eggs the rider to push more and more.
          </p>
          <h2>
            <strong>Who</strong> <strong>should</strong> <strong>buy</strong>
            <strong>it</strong> <strong>then</strong>?
          </h2>
          <p>
            No fancy electronics. No ride modes. No quickshifter. No TFT
            instrument cluster. Lack of premium cycle parts. On paper at least,
            MT-03&rsquo;s case looks like a lost one. Its future starts looking
            even more bleak once you factor in its sticker price. Take this for
            instance,
            <strong
              >the Aprilia RS 457 is almost INR 40,000 cheaper than the
              MT-03</strong
            >. The KTM 390 Duke? More than a Lakh cheaper! Before you neglect
            the MT-03 completely, let me rest my case.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like I said, I, personally, didn&rsquo;t care about the price tag.
            Nor do I give two flying saucers about what it lacks. The Yamaha
            MT-03 is all about the ride experience and when you factor that in,
            it is a serious motorcycle. It might not look and feel that
            arresting but the way that engine behaves and the chassis reacts to
            inputs, the MT-03 will surely cast a magic spell. It is a shame that
            given its price tag, we might not see many MT-03s going about on our
            streets. A good motorcycle let down by its sticker price. Not the
            first time we have seen that happening. (Hello, R3!)
