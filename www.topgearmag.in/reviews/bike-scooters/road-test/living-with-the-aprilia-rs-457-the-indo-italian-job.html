          <p>
            (A note to self) You have to tread on a very thin line, Anant.
            Don&rsquo;t put up a masquerade given how much you love Aprilia as a
            manufacturer. Grab your cynical lenses and a wider perspective
            because you aren&rsquo;t just a mere motorcyclist anymore,
            you&rsquo;re supposed to be an automotive journalist. You&rsquo;re
            supposed to report, not rave.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although I missed out on the racetrack rendezvous with the Aprilia
            RS 457 and Lorenzo Savadori, I was keen to put the RS through its
            paces in the real world. The &lsquo;self-assigned&rsquo; task at
            hand was to live with the RS in different scenarios to gauge whether
            it is just an angry track scorcher or is it capable of delivering on
            multiple fronts. I knew it was not a swiss knife. What I
            didn&rsquo;t know is that it is an Italian stiletto but with a
            slight twist. Stabbing people with its pointy end? It was
            particularly developed for that but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you
            cannot chop veggies with it, right?
          </p>
          <p>
            Even before you&rsquo;re enchanted with other elements of the RS,
            its irresistible Italian silhouette would charm you into writing a
            love sonnet about it. Become a little Shakespearean in the process.
            A shrunken down RSV4, that&rsquo;s exactly how the RS 457 looks. It
            doesn&rsquo;t lose its purpose in the wake of being pretty. It is
            not a social media influencer, it is an Italian supermodel with wits
            to go by too. For instance, take the bulky front half of the
            motorcycle, imparting the RS with big bike looks and feels but as
            you pan your eyes towards the rear, it just ends too soon. The RS
            457 is a compact motorcycle but it doesn&rsquo;t feel like one once
            you look at it from up front. I loved being on the RS because
            wherever I went, I could feel drool all around. Not just in my
            helmet. The RS has a striking road presence and I would go as far as
            saying that it is the most gorgeous motorcycle that you can get
            under INR 5 Lakh. Fight me on that and you will get buried with so
            many gorgeous angles of the RS that I&rsquo;m going to throw right
            in your face. Despite being Indianized like the pizzas that we eat,
            this Italian recipe hasn&rsquo;t lost its flavor. A thought that
            popped in my head several times when I was dancing with the RS.
          </p>
          <p>
            Its compact dimensions get even more pronounced once you sit on the
            motorcycle. However, as it turned out, one can actually think of
            going for a long roadtrip astride the RS. It is just a matter of
            getting accustomed to the aggressive riding stance. You have to
            adapt to the supersport lifestyle and once you do that, it is a
            barrage of low-hanging fruits. Treat yourself. Sure, your wrists
            would start paining after some time but the sense of involvement
            with the motorcycle is something that is perennial to the RS. Guess
            what? I went touring on it with a pillion. It is indeed a stiletto
            that can also chop veggies, remember? I was expecting myself to be
            drowned in expletives coming out of the pretty face of my pillion
            princess but that wasn&rsquo;t the case. The pillion seat is
            actually usable for weekend runs and short city bursts.
          </p>
          <p>
            The powertrain is the star of the show. Despite hailing from an
            Indian stable, all the 47 ponies tied are thoroughbred Italians. The
            powertrain is a masterpiece. Developed in Noale, this recipe is
            being cooked at Aprilia&rsquo;s Baramati plant. You would expect a
            lot of dilution in terms of approach and feel of the motorcycle but
            boy, the RS is a true-blue Italian in that regard. It sticks true to
            what Aprilia has stood for - exhilarating performance. The RS is an
            angry child, ready to pounce ahead with each blip of the throttle.
            This engaging behavior is imparted by the huge torque waves that it
            produces lower down in the rev range. You would expect the RS to
            behave like a supersport, rewarding the rider only higher up in the
            rev range but that isn&rsquo;t the case here. The torque on offer is
            downright addictive and it has spoiled other motorcycles for me
            which require you to pin the throttle if you wish to gain some
            grins. It doesn&rsquo;t mean that it lacks drama in the top end
            because it might hit its rev ceiling of 10,500rpm too soon but the
            progression till there is wild. Italians used to love their
            theatrical performances and the RS is no different. What adds to the
            show is the orchestra. The RS has a 270-degree firing order which
            has blessed it with a V-Twin like roar and rideability. It looks
            gorgeous but it sings even better.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was fated to be a racetrack weapon but the engine&rsquo;s
            character has bestowed the RS with good commuting behavior as well.
            Since it has spades of low end grunt, it doesn&rsquo;t mind
            puttering around in town at all. It won&rsquo;t smack you in the
            face for riding slow and when the time arrives to go fast, the
            engine is more than willing to set the tarmac on fire. It is not an
            entirely refined unit though but the vibrations are muted enough to
            pass off as character of the motorcycle. The only gripe that I have
            with the RS in this aspect is the transmission. The 6-speed unit is
            a botchy one. I would have loved a bit more slickness and
            smoothness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Being an Aprilia, the RS 457 had to tick a few important boxes
            including handling prowess. If someone isn&rsquo;t completely sold
            on the RS for the powertrain and looks, the dynamics will be the
            final stamp of approval. Not that it was asking for any! The RS is
            built around an aluminium frame ( first of its kind in its class )
            with the engine acting as the stressed member. The frame and the
            tuning of the suspension has lent the RS godly capabilities
            according to the segment it competes in. It is always on the hunt
            for apexes and when twisty roads arrive, it just goes on a frantic
            prowl. It is an absolute predator. A blood-thirsty invader looking
            to ravage the kingdoms once previously helmed by other
            manufacturers. The urgency with which it tips into a corner is
            intoxicating with the RS sending you in a mode of trance. The
            suspension supports the chassis really well.

            The level of precision doesn&rsquo;t come at the cost of ride
            quality. The stock suspension setup is pliant enough to soak in
            bumps and undulations that our Indian roads have in abundance. The
            setup is so beautiful that on one fine evening, I didn&rsquo;t shy
            away from taking the RS for a mild offroad section to witness a
            gorgeous sunset. The RS did it, with a pillion on board. What more
            can I say about the capabilities of the RS? Apart from the 6-speed
            transmission, the spongy front brake also left me wanting for more.
            More of everything including bite, feedback and consistency.

            Minds at Noale and the hands of Baramati have cooked up the perfect
            Indo-Italian recipe. Imagine a tandoori paneer pizza, which is also
            more affordable than its competition while bursting with flavour.
            The RS is a wild child that can also be tamed if the need arises. If
            I had to buy just one motorcycle under INR 5 Lakh to fulfill my one
            horse stable dream, the RS 457 would deserve a serious
            consideration. I was sold on ADVs given the practicality that they
            bring to the fold but oh boy, a gorgeous Italian woman who&rsquo;s
            willing to dance with you, showing you some tricks along the course,
            can make you rethink things. If I had the moolah, I would have made
            this supersport dream a reality. The RS strays far away from the
            rational notions because of the things it can make you feel.
