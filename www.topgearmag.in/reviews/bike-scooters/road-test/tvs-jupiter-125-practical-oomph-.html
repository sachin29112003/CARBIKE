          <p>
            Indian third largest two-wheeler manufacturer, TVS Motors, in recent
            years, has transformed itself into a most sensible brand. TVS has
            made its mark among middle-class Indians as a most practical and
            stylish scooter manufacturer. Jupiter is the runaway success for the
            brand as the scooter sector in India has shaped quite a bit in
            recent years. Ever since its launch, Jupiter 110 has had premium yet
            practical appeal to the mass-consumers. On the other hand, NTorq
            lured the dynamic buyers with its peppy 125cc motor and sporty
            looks. So, when TVS launched the 125cc Jupiter last year, my senior
            Yash Sunil was quite impressed when he drove it at the TVS Hosur
            test facility track. But, out on the Indian roads, does the
            Jupiter125 still maintain its practical quotient remained
            unanswered. So we have spent a weak with the Jupiter 125 hovering
            around the city and on highways to tell you how different does it
            performs in the real world.
          </p>
          <h3>Verdict</h3>
          <p>
            Practicality quotient is aptly fulfilling in the TVS Jupiter 125.
            Powerful engine, distinctive styling, first-in-class features,
            mature ride quality and most importantly,decent fuel efficiency
            figures triumph the case for Jupiter 125. Around Rs 85,000*
            (ex-showroom) for the top end disc alloy wheel variant is an
            expensive affair for the scooter. Still, the premium appeal,
            functional characters and convenience features make it a fantastic
            choice.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="tab-content" id="tab-content-4" style="display: none">
          <h3>Design and Features</h3>
          <p>
            The Jupiter 125 is one of those sophisticated good looking machines
            that grabs attention. Especially in this Dawn Orange colour. Talking
            about colour, the paint quality and chrome used on the scooter gives
            it a plush appeal. Also, some of the body panels are crafted of
            metal, giving Jupiter 125 a robust stance. The tastefully integrated
            chrome finishes around LED headlamps, side panels, rear view
            mirrors, and the speedometer make it look quite distinctive.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Jupiter 125 gets a part-analogue, part digital speedometer that
            offers all necessary information like fuel consumption, distance to
            empty and instantaneous fuel consumption figures, as well as trip
            meters. The most distinctive feature is the external fuel cap placed
            on the left side of the inside of the apron. Well, you need to be
            extra cautious while fueling up the scooter as the fuel lid opening
            is relatively small. As mentioned earlier, the fuel tank is now
            placed under the floorboard, which translates into an ample amount
            of under-seat storage space, 33 litres to be precise. Also, there is
            a provision for mobile charging, as well as there is an extra 2
            litres of storage space for your mobile phone or other small
            belongings.
          </p>

        <div class="tab-content" id="tab-content-6" style="display: none">
          <h3>Performance</h3>
          <p>
            First things first, Jupiter gets a new 124.8cc, single-cylinder,
            air-cooled engine that produces 8.2hp of power and 10.5 Nm of
            torque. Whereas its sporty sibling, NTorq 125, produces 9.4hp of
            power and the same 10.5 Nm of torque. Well, the big difference,
            though, is the number of valves per cylinder. Jupiter 125 uses a
            two-valve arrangement, whereas the NTorq gets a three-valve. The
            two-valve arrangement compromises performance, but it increases fuel
            efficiency. And one expects handsome fuel efficiency with the
            practical scooter, don&rsquo;t they? Talking about efficiency, I
            hammered the scooter pretty hard through city traffic and highways
            but still managed to deliver me around 38-42 km/l of fuel economy.
            Further on, the intelliGO technology is a boon on this scooter that
            further enhances its economy by shutting off the engine when it is
            stationary for more than 10 seconds. It has also got an integrated
            starter generator for silent starts, smart, isn&rsquo;t it?
          </p>
          <p>
            The engine is quite torquey with an adequate performance from low to
            mid-range. The scooter builds up speed linearly, and acceleration is
            quite dull post-70-75kmph. The engine is pretty punchy and sporty
            under city conditions, where it will spend most of its time. The
            brownie point, though, is the refinement of the motor. It is quite
            smooth most of the time, and only when you throttle it hard the buzz
            of the motor can be felt. The only complaint is the start-stop
            system. It is not as communicative and intuitive as one would expect
            it to be, and I think TVS will rectify that issue soon.
          </p>
          <h3>Ride and Handling</h3>
          <p>
            As soon as you sit on the scooter, you will appreciate seating
            comfort, thanks to the longer seat length of 65mm compared to the
            110cc Jupiter. Moreover, the seat height is 765mm, which is great
            for short riders as well. Cheery on the cake is the light and agile
            handling of the scooter. Manoeuvring the scooter in the city traffic
            is a breeze. The fuel tank is now placed under the floorboard, which
            translates into lowering the centre of gravity, thus giving
            confident handling.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ride quality is the forte of the Jupiter 125. The scooter gets
            telescopic hydraulic suspension at the front, and Monotube Inverted
            Gas (MIG) filled shock with spring aid 3-way adjustable suspension
            at the rear. The scooter soaks in bumps and potholes quite easily
            and maintains its composure at high speeds. But, cursing during the
            dark at high speed is a little troublesome as the light illumination
            is pretty dull, and we wish TVS to work on the illumination
            department.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Jupiter 125 comes equipped with a 220mm disc at the front and a
            130mm drum at the rear with the TVS&rsquo;s Synchronised Braking
            Technology. The SBT works efficiently, even when slamming the brake
            harder at decent high speeds. No such incidents of skidding or
            losing out composure have been noticed. More so ever, the braking
            feedback is quite confidence-inspiring as well.
