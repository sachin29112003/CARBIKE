            Whenever we say that we are on the cusp of transition, the future is
            changing rapidly; sooner or later, we must face the realities of the
            EV world. We tend to say this with a heavy heart as deep inside, we
            still want to experience the limit of an internal combustion engine,
            mainly with bikes. Ever since the Bangalore-based startup
            Ultraviolette showcased its F77 bike, it intrigued a sense of
            curiosity to see it in the real world. After delays and delays, and
            changes after changes - it finally made it into the market. Ever
            since it was showcased, I was pretty excited to ride it, primarily
            because it looked damm fast, and secondly - how well does it evoke
            thrilling emotions? F77 Recon puts itself in a unique proposition
            wherein one has no reference point to compare it against. Despite
            already owning a KTM Duke 390, I was drawn to the electric F77 for
            its striking appearance and impressive potential sporty character. I
            have ridden it through city confines and taken highway runs to check
            if the experience is yet wholesome enough to replace ICE
            bikes.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
          <h3>VERDICT</h3>
          <p dir="ltr">
            Let&#39;s put the money equation out of context and think this way -
            Does this bike evoke a sense of enthusiasm with its form factor? To
            me - Yes. But will I choose it over an ICE motorcycle? And
            that&#39;s where the price comes into play; at around Rs 4.55 lakh
            (exshowroom), the F77 Recon is a bit expensive. But for some, if
            money is not an issue, and they would like to own something that
            looks unconventional and rides differently; the F77 is the only
            pick. It is imperative that the brand concentrates its efforts on
            improving specific areas. Firstly, the braking and regenerative
            calibration could be better, and the fit and finish need
            improvement. But apart from these shortcomings, the startup&#39;s
            efforts are commendable in building a product that goes fast and
            far, handles well and, most importantly, looks excellent .
            Currently, the bike is only sold in Bengaluru and subsequently the
            brand will expand its operation across India soon. The F77 Recon has
            shown the startup potential in building performance bikes. Once they
            start their own One Make Championship, a lot of learnings and
            feedback will be further implemented to make this &#39;THE&#39;
            potential electric bike for enthusiasts.

            <strong>LOOKS, FEATURES AND ERGONOMICS.</strong>
          </h4>
          <p>
            The influence of aviation design on Ultraviolette F77 is immediately
            apparent. The bike looks unique in its own way, and the design
            elements it carries make it look fast at a standstill. The side body
            panels have nice edges and creases to make them attractive. In a
            neat-looking side panel, one would notice a small fin that serves
            the purpose of providing air to the powertrain unit. Not just that,
            it also acts as a safety member during a fall or crash. The
            suspension shroudes at the front with a tastefully designed LED
            headlamp unit would be hard to ignore. At every traffic signal,
            inquiries about the bike are inevitable. F77 was truly
            attention-grabbing. The rear end is also nicely designed with a
            cool-looking tail lamp. However, the number plate extension and the
            indicators look a bit more flimsy when viewed on the go. The
            material and paint quality is also the favourable reason that makes
            the bike look appealing. Everything from the design of the wheels to
            the swingarms appears to be distinctive. The bike needs improvement
            in certain areas, especially the flimsy charging cap. A sturdier
            cover with a button or electric control would be a better solution.
          </p>
          <p>
            The 5.0-inch TFT display of the Ultraviolette F77 is designed to be
            easily readable even in the brightest sunlight. Regarding connected
            tech features, F77 gets a built-in 4G SIM that provides information
            such as navigation with real-time traffic assists and geofencing.
            One can store essential documents such as a driver&#39;s license,
            insurance and RC. All basic commands can be operated using
            PlayStation-inspired buttons, which users can quickly get accustomed
            to. The motor will not start immediately upon powering on the bike.
            There will be a brief delay as the display boots up before the motor
            can be activated. Including a parking brake is highly recommended
            for the sake of convenience. Relying only on the front or rear
            brakes to control F77 movement in traffic can be difficult.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the F77, the rider&#39;s triangle is strategically placed
            forward, giving it a bold and dynamic look while still retaining its
            athletic personality. It was not cumbersome. However, my wrist
            started to hurt after an hour-long ride. The seat height of 800 mm
            is adequate to ensure comfortable accommodation. I (5.8ft ) could
            easily keep both feet on the ground. The seats are a bit firmer, but
            I do not find any complaints about their comfort. Agreed, cushing
            could have helped to make it feel better. However, in the long run,
            one gets used to it and finds peace with it. The weight of the F77
            is on the heavier side- 207 kgs; thus, muscling it around would be a
            task in itself. Fortunately, it has both reverse and forward modes,
            but there is no clear button for activating them. It takes some time
            to figure out how to use it.

          <h4>BATTERY AND PERFORMANCE</h4>
          <p dir="ltr">
            Ultraviolette F77 comes with two battery pack variants - a standard
            7.1kWh and a bigger 10.3 kWh. We had a top-spec Recon variant with a
            10.3kWh battery pack. This is one of the bravest attempts so far to
            provide this big battery pack with an IDC range of 307km. Not just
            the range, but the power figures on paper are surprisingly healthy,
            with around 39 hp of peak power and 95 Nm of torque. I, too, hold
            the bike to a high standard of performance, as its appearance and
            specifications suggest. However, in reality, it isn&#39;t a
            neck-paining acceleration. Ultraviolette says they have purposely
            done this to keep the traction and wheelspin in check. The bike gets
            three riding modes - Glide, Combat and Ballistic. Glide could be
            better termed as an Eco mode, wherein the bike focuses on maximising
            range. It feels a bit dull to use this mode; however, in stuck-go
            traffic, you are better with the Glide mode. Things get to change in
            Combat mode. It was the most suitable mode as it had the perfect
            character of performance that one expects from a bike like this.
            Then there is a Ballistic mode - it&#39;s quick but not
            entertainingly thrilling, it has a good quick linear acceleration
            rather than a sudden torque surge as one would expect from a sporty
            e-bike like F77.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
            The throttle calibration is flawless, providing a rapid surge of up
            to 50-60km/hr. From there, the acceleration is effortless and allows
            for a smooth ride. Once one gets the hang of the throttle
            calibration, modulating the inputs to get the best out of the bike
            could be satisfying. Acceleration of 0-100km/hr around 8 seconds
            puts it in comparison to 250-300 cc bikes. However, the feel of an
            EV doing this acceleration is so different. Yes, one would argue,
            bro - you do not know how engaging it feels to rev the engine and
            change gears but believe me when I say F77 also feels quite fun to
            throttle hard. Different does not always necessarily mean
            non-engaging.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
            In real-world usage , F77 is competent enough to give a range of
            around 210-220 km (switching between Glide and Combat mode according
            to need ) .There are three modes of regen as well - low, medium and
            high. However, I barely felt any resistance, even in the high mode.
            Better regenerative braking calibration could further enhance the
            real-world range. In terms of charging, customers have to pay Rs
            26,650 extra for the Boost charger and Rs 42,500 to have both the
            standard and Boost chargers. The Boost charger is quite heavy to
            carry around; one can either mount it on the rear seat or carry it
            in a backpack, so planning a road trip will not be an easy affair.
            The Boost charger has a 3.0kW capacity with a max output voltage and
            current of 58V and 50A, respectively, good enough to serve the full
            charging time of around 5-5:30 hrs.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h4>RIDE, HANDLING AND BRAKING&nbsp;</h4>
          <p dir="ltr">
            The weight of the F77 Recon is on the heavier side, with over 207kgs
            of weight - it becomes cumbersome to muscle it around city traffic.
            But once you gain the momentum, the weight tries to disappear. The
            suspension is on the firmer side for a reason. Firstly, the
            bike&#39;s character is sporty in nature, and secondly, to avoid
            bottoming out of suspensions over the bad paths that could cause
            damage to the battery pack. The rear mono-shock is too firm that it
            jerks off to its original position, thus hampering the ride quality.
            However, one can adjust both suspensions for preload.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
            Corner Carver! That&#39;s what we like to call it. Everyone from our
            team loved the way it holds its composure around the corners and
            itches one to push harder. The MRF Steel Brace tyres further add
            muchrequired grip to boost confidence. There is a nice whining sound
            of the motor to add a persona of electric performance. However, the
            chain noise and squeaky noises dull the experience. Another sector
            of improvement would be the brakes. It has a 320mm disc at the
            front, and a 230mm disc at the rear with a dual-channel ABS setup.
            The braking performance could have been better ; it does have an
            assuring bite, but the feedback could have been better. During hard
            braking, ABS kicks in, making the front end shaky, thus lowering the
            confidence.&nbsp;
