          <p>
            Things work a little differently when a manufacturer is driven by
            passion, not sheer numbers. Their love towards what they do trickles
            down to the vehicles. Sometimes, it is so evident that despite their
            shortcomings, they still manage to seduce us in the most
            mechanically and emotional way possible. This breed of automotive
            euphoria is what they call passion projects. The 500 kilometers
            spent rioting around with the TVS Apache RTR 310 convinced me of
            something. It isn&rsquo;t just a flagship, it is a passion project
            where TVS just wanted to flex. And the Apache does flex, hard!
          </p>
          <p>
            Not just muscles and brawn, but brain too. We will get into that
            later because the elephant in the room is actually a wasp. An angry
            one at that because just look at that bug-eyed face! The Fury Yellow
            paint shade also added to this creature&rsquo;s persona. The front
            headlamp unit not only gives the Apache a very imposing and radical
            front end, it also has practical benefits. Even the stock LED
            headlamp setup would suffice for nightcrawlers sinning around when
            the sun sets. The rest of the bodywork stays as radical as it can
            get, with the chopped off rear end adding to its freestyler appeal.
            Sure, the overall design might not be to everyone&rsquo;s taste but
            there&rsquo;s one thing for sure - it is indeed a mean looking
            streetfighter that is also pretty well built. While its faired
            sibling would slay at beauty pageants, the RTR would be organizing a
            riot right in front of the venue, calling for a boycott for such
            practices.
          </p>
          <p>
            Naked streetfighters will always stay close to my heart. They invoke
            a sense of carelessness in me which is not instilled by other genres
            of motorcycling. The RTR 310, turned out to be no different. Even
            its ergonomics scream &lsquo;streetfighter&rsquo; on top of their
            lungs. A wide, straight handlebar is accompanied by rearset
            footpegs, granting the rider with a commanding riding position and
            uncluttered cockpit view. The seat height stands at just 800mm,
            making it an easy motorcycle even for the people who aren&rsquo;t
            blessed with towering heights.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            The RTR 310 isn&rsquo;t just a RR 310 in a stripped off form, it is
            much more than that. Mechanically speaking, it is powered by the
            same 312cc, single-cylinder, liquid-cooled motor that has spawned
            four TVS and BMW motorcycles so far, apart from the RTR. In the RTR
            though, TVS has tweaked the fuel map, intake, and exhaust. The said
            changes have transformed the RTR into an animal. The thing is, it
            now puts down 35.6hp and 28.7Nm, which is 1.6hp and 0.7Nm higher
            than its stablemates. Shorter gearing has also contributed to its
            wild demeanours. Let&rsquo;s get into it?
          </p>
          <p>
            Before I start jotting down a love letter, it would be wise to list
            down the negatives first. The RTR 310 is bestowed with so many
            electronics, it would impart existential crisis on some of the much
            more expensive, multi-cylinder powered motorcycles. Five ride modes,
            cornering traction control and ABS, wheelie control, cruise
            control&hellip; (word limit, Anant!)! And, a lot more. After riding
            the RTR 310 in each and every mode, I believe they could have been
            calibrated a lot better. For some reason, despite getting a lower
            state of tune the low and mid range in the Urban mode is explosive!
            However, the engine juiced out at 138kmph. The other
            performance-oriented modes include Sport and Track but I found
            myself mostly in the Urban mode because it turned out to be not only
            the smoothest but most consistent and not to forget&hellip;
            explosive! Also, in Sport and Track mode, the sense of the
            motorcycle getting slowed down because of engine braking was so
            subdued that I instantly shifted back to Urban mode.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            That being said, I believe that the 312cc engine that was jointly
            developed by TVS and BMW has run its course because this is the best
            tune that it has received according to me. It should die as a hero,
            rather than finding itself in another iteration with flaws. The
            low-end and mid-range might have been the star of the show but that
            doesn&rsquo;t mean that the RTR runs out of breath in higher revs.
            It keeps pulling hard till it smooches the rev ceiling. Despite
            trying with all their might, TVS hasn&rsquo;t been able to shield
            this engine from vibrations. They are even more pronounced in the
            RTR but the ride experience is so engaging that they go unnoticed,
            sneakily passing off as &lsquo;character&rsquo;. This makes it a
            hoot to ride in the city and around canyons but given the frisky and
            vibey nature of the engine, I wouldn&rsquo;t suggest grand touring
            on it. However, riding the RTR the way it&rsquo;s supposed to be
            ridden makes one feel like taming a wild animal. Once you start
            doing that, it is a rewarding experience to fight with it and then
            make wild wild love. What supports the carnage is the bi-directional
            quickshifter which works flawlessly.

            The 310 platform might have been riddled with powertrain flaws but
            there&rsquo;s one thing for sure, the chassis is sublime. Even in
            the RTR 310, it strikes a natural balance between comfort and
            agility. One can even spec their RTR 310 with adjustable suspension
            at both ends, enhancing its capabilities to a new horizon. The RTR
            310 rides over undulations with composure and in attack mode, it
            bestows the learnings of TVS&rsquo; racing department onto the
            rider. The brakes are sharp and provide good feedback too. The only
            area where it felt lacking was the initial braking bite. Apart from
            that, finding more flaws would be a tough nut to crack. Especially
            when you factor in other premium components like the Michelin Road 5
            tyres which provide you with the much-needed confidence to put a
            leash on this beast.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            The tech on offer is what makes this pony, a special and futuristic
            one. Not just guns, but TVS went all weapons blazing while loading
            up the RTR 310. Apart from a whole hoard of electric nannies keeping
            a keen eye on you, the RTR 310 is also equipped with cooled seats
            and cruise control. The cooled seat option makes the seat a lot
            harder than it should be and leaves wanting for more in terms of
            function as well. Cruise control, however, worked without any
            issues, imparting some touring cred as well.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            After a spirited weekend ride, I could formulate why the RTR 310 is
            a special motorcycle. It has flaws, no doubt about it but the
            boundless stickers splattered over it, including
            &lsquo;Hyperspec&rsquo; (what does it mean, TVS?) pronounce out loud
            that it was made with passion. Made with love for engineering and in
            a more evolved state, motorcycling. It stands as a living, moving
            testament to TVS&rsquo; hunger for advancement and their love for
            racing. As a journalist, I cannot say it is the perfect motorcycle
            which would fulfill your one bike garage dream but as a motorcyclist
            who loves fast sprints across town and blurry weekend runs, the RTR
            turned out to be an absolute hoot.
