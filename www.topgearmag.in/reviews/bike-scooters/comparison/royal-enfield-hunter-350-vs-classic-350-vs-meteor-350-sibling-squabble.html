            Sticking true to the brand&rsquo;s tagline &lsquo;Made like a
            Gun&rsquo;, Royal Enfield is planning to go all guns blazing on its
            rivals and the latest firearm to join its arsenal is the new Hunter
            350. But was there a need to spawn yet another motorcycle based on
            the J platform when the Meteor 350 and the Classic 350 were already
            racking up astronomical sales numbers? Now that we have tasted the
            most accessible Royal Enfield ever, the answer is affirmative!
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
            The Meteor 350 and the Classic 350 are true blue Royal Enfields
            which might be a little intimidating and less inviting for the
            riders who have just tasted the fun of motorcycling. But still,
            choosing between the three Royal Enfields might get a little
            confusing because all the motorcycles share similar performance
            figures, the same engine and the underpinnings are very similar to a
            fair margin. Allow me to dilute the confusion a little and demystify
            the air surrounding the modern-age Royal Enfield 350s.
          </p>
          <h3>Gentlemen vs Hipster</h3>
          <p dir="ltr">
            Despite sharing the basic recipe of a retro roadster like a round
            headlamp, teardrop-shaped fuel tank and minimalistic bodywork, all
            the Royal Enfield 350s will appeal to a different set of riders.
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
            The first thing that you would realize after seeing the Hunter 350
            in flesh is how compact it looks and feels after you swing your leg
            over it. And that alone would provide some mental relief to people
            who are new to the world of Royal Enfield motorcycles.
            https://youtu.be/2XD930rxoO8 Since this is also sort of a retro
            roadster, Royal Enfield couldn&rsquo;t have done something
            revolutionary when it comes to its overall aesthetics. But still,
            the Hunter 350 manages to differentiate itself with its hipster
            attire. Compact dimensions, fork gaiters and funky graphics are some
            of the most prominent visual elements of the Hunter.
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
            The Classic 350 however, is a purebred retro roadster with oodles of
            old-school charm. It is great how Royal Enfield has managed to fill
            up an entirely new wine in almost the same bottle. If you wish to
            include an authentic retro motorcycle in your garage, the Classic
            350 makes a really strong case for itself.
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
            As far as styling is concerned, the Meteor 350 finds itself slotted
            right in the middle of the Hunter and the Classic. It is neither as
            funky as the Hunter nor as retro as the Classic. However, with its
            laidback cruiser credentials like a low-slung seat and a windscreen
            up front, it manages to retain its own visual identity. In
            RE&rsquo;s own words, the Meteor 350 is a mild-mannered mile muncher
            but we will come back to that later!
          </p>
          <h3>Hi there, Pythagoras!</h3>
          <p dir="ltr">
            Geometry was Royal Enfield&amp;rsquo;s best friend while developing
            the Hunter 350 because apart from its stylish looks, it is the
            retuned underpinnings that set the Hunter 350 apart from the Classic
            and the Meteor 350. Take the wheel and tyre sizes for instance! The
            Hunter 350 has become the first modern Royal Enfield to deploy
            17-inch wheels at both ends. It also gets the widest front tyre
            which is a 110-section unit, as compared to the 100-section tyres
            found on the Meteor and the Classic. The Hunter 350 also gets a wide
            140-section rear tyre, which is comparable to the Meteor 350. But
            then again, major differences lie in the wheel sizes because both
            the Meteor and the Classic make do with a 19-inch front wheel. While
            the Meteor gets a 17-inch wheel at the rear, the Classic 350
            soldiers on with an 18-inch unit.
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
            Moreover, the Hunter 350 also boasts of the shortest wheelbase
            amongst all the RE 350s. At 1370mm, the Hunter 350&amp;rsquo;s
            wheelbase is 20mm shorter than the Classic the 30mm shorter than the
            Meteor. Even the rake and trail of the Hunter 350 is a lot sharper
            than the Classic and Meteor.
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
            Where Royal Enfield has smashed a home run when it comes to the
            Hunter 350 is the kerb weight because the Hunter tips the scale at
            181 kgs, making it 14kgs lighter than the Classic and 10kgs lighter
            than the Meteor. It all boils down to lighter components, a new rear
            subframe and the elimination of the hefty metal footpeg cradle that
            we see on the Classic and the Meteor. All these ingredients form the
            perfect recipe for an agile motorcycle that can hunt down the urban
            elements with proficiency. It&amp;rsquo;s about time that we talk
            about how these cardinal numbers translate to the real-world riding
            experience.
          </p>
          <h3>Same heart, slightly different beats</h3>
          <p dir="ltr">
            The Hunter 350 is powered by the same thumping 350cc single-cylinder
            unit that powers the Classic and the Meteor. However, RE is claiming
            that they&rsquo;ve tweaked the fuelling and the engine mapping to
            suit the characteristics of the Hunter. The performance figures of
            all the 350s are exactly similar but how that performance is put
            down on the road, now differs slightly. The 350cc engine first
            marked its debut in the Meteor and then was borrowed by the Classic.
            Compared to the Meteor, the Classic feels a little laid back in its
            overall character. It eggs you to take it slow and feel the thump
            while coasting on the highways.
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
            The throttle response is a bit sharper in the Meteor and it feels
            more lively as compared to the Classic but it&amp;rsquo;s the Hunter
            which takes the leap ahead. The combination of less weight to carry
            around and sharp throttle response means that the Hunter plunges
            ahead with eagerness that sets it apart from the other two
            motorcycles.
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
            Thankfully, the overall character of the engine remains same though
            and that&rsquo;s a good thing because this engine is a big step up
            from the previous generation of REs. The vibrations are negligible
            and the motor feels lively at low and mid rpms. It&amp;rsquo;s when
            you try to wring it to bring it that the engine starts losing breath
            with the powertrain reminding you that it&amp;rsquo;s not meant to
            be ridden that way. The low-revving and torquey nature of the Hunter
            is a boon while negotiating the traffic. This is yet another
            department where you can tell that which motorcycle will be a
            perfect fit for the garage.
          </p>
          <h3>Leisure mode or Attack mode, you choose!</h3>
          <p dir="ltr">
            The revised mechanicals of the Hunter start making sense as soon as
            you swing your leg over it. The handlebar is wide and low, typical
            of what we see on the naked streetfighters in this price bracket.
            While the Classic and Meteor get slightly forward set footpegs, the
            Hunter gets a rearset unit. As far as ergonomics are considered, it
            is the Meteor which scores high on the comfort front. The Hunter, on
            the other hand, comes out as the sportiest proposition as you sit
            while hunching a little forward with the rider triangle making you
            feel that you&rsquo;re riding any typical 200cc naked streetfighter.
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
            The suspension and braking components might be vastly similar but
            that&rsquo;s all on the spec sheet because in reality, things are
            slightly different. I found the Classic to be the most supple of the
            lot while the Meteor wasn&rsquo;t too far behind either. Here as
            well, the Hunter feels a bit sportier and firmer as compared to the
            Meteor and the Classic. The ride is on the firmer side with the twin
            shock absorbers at the back making you feel everything that&rsquo;s
            happening underneath. If you are looking for a comfortable
            motorcycle, the Meteor or the Classic would make more sense but if
            you&rsquo;re looking for something fun and engaging, you cannot go
            wrong with the Hunter.
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
            The shorter wheelbase, smaller wheels and less heft to carry around
            really do make a world of a difference because the Hunter 350 feels
            light and quick on its feet. And this is something that CANNOT be
            said about the Classic and the meteor. &amp;lsquo;Neutral&amp;rsquo;
            is the best word to describe the handling of the Meteor. It gets the
            job done without sending any warning signals on your cockpit but
            that&rsquo;s about it. The Classic 350 falls in the same category
            but its handling is slightly lazier as compared to the Meteor but
            the Hunter is unlike any of these two motorcycles. Be it filtering
            through the traffic or attacking some corners, the Hunter puts fun
            in everything. The Highways is where the Hunter loses out on some
            points because both the Classic and the Meteor feel a bit more
            planted than the Meteor. Hunter&amp;rsquo;s athletic positioning is
            further highlighted by its braking setup. It shared the same braking
            components with the other two motorcycles but RE has thrown in a new
            master cylinder which provides more feedback and slightly more bite
            as compared to the Meteor and the Classic. However, I believe that
            the braking performance of all the 350s could be a little better as
            the wooden feeling associated with Royal Enfields is still
            prominently felt.
          </p>
          <h3>Not all sunshine and rainbows, still!</h3>
          <p dir="ltr">
            Although these 350s are supposed to take the charge ahead for the
            company in these modern, competitive times, they still fall short on
            a few counts. Compared to their rivals, the 350 trio doesn&rsquo;t
            get that many features and make do with just the essential ones.
            Royal Enfields have been notorious for quality issues and we are sad
            to report that despite being better than their previous generations,
            some strains of this trait are still left behind.
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
            Our long termer Hunter 350&rsquo;s right hand side rear view mirror
            became loose with just 200 kms on the odo and the Meteor 350 died in
            the middle of the shoot because of loose battery terminals. These
            kind of issues keep reminding you that the overall build quality of
            Royal Enfield motorcycles might have improved by a fair margin but
            there&rsquo;s still a long way to go. Another department which could
            have used some more polishing is the suspension department. Given
            our infamous indian roads, the Hunter 350 definitely could have been
            a better motorcycle if its ride quality wasn&rsquo;t this jittery.
            Moreover, some more modern-day features like LED lights and turn
            indicators would go a long way in making people realize that Royal
            Enfield is serious about the game.
          </p>
          <h3>Still scratching your head?</h3>
          <p>
            Although the differences were pretty evident right from the start,
            it was essential to ride these motorcycles back to back to grasp the
            importance of these changes. Despite sharing almost all the
            essential components with the other two 350s, the Hunter 350 really
            does feel different! And it&amp;#39;s a good different, mind you!
            Moreover, the sweet price tag makes the Hunter 350 an even better
            proposition.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you wish to be a part of the Royal Enfield culture and lifestyle,
            all the J platform motorcycles serve as a good entry point.
            Simmering it down for you guys, the Hunter 350 would be an ideal
            choice for someone who doesn&rsquo;t like the heft and bulk of Royal
            Enfields and wants a motorcycle that can make their mundane commutes
            a bit lively. However, if you&rsquo;re fine with the traditional
            Royal Enfield traits, it doesn&rsquo;t get more authentic and retro
            than the Classic 350. The Meteor is developed for the highways and
            for the tourers out there who love crunching miles, nice and slow.

          <h3>Pricing</h3>
          <p dir="ltr">
            When Royal Enfield dropped the prices of the Hunter 350, it sent
            shivers down the spine of its rivals and rightly so! The Retro
            variant of the Hunter 350 starts at 1.49 Lakh while the top-spec
            variant goes all the way up to 1.68 Lakh. The Classic 350 starts at
            INR 1.9 Lakh and goes all the way up to around 2.2 Lakh. The Meteor
            350&rsquo;s prices hover in the same range as the Classic 350.
