            The arrival of thoroughbred, purpose-built offerings like
            ADV-tourers and faired sportsbikes has hit the industry like a
            battering ram. Gone are the days when Indian motorcyclists had
            limited options because now, every genre is dripping with offerings
            with their own individualistic flavours. We are spoiled, it is safe
            to say that. However, not every motorcyclist out there wishes to
            kick off a rooster tail while trail hunting, or venture into the
            unknown&hellip; or get their knee down. There are people out there
            who love motorcycles because they take them places. They don&rsquo;t
            care about the motorcycle&rsquo;s outright capabilities. They care
            about pure motorcycling. Trundling along with gorgeous vistas
            passing by while being one with the motorcycle. One good look around
            and you would know that nothing captures the essence of pure
            motorcycling better than the latest crop of modern-retro
            motorcycles.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ask a kid to draw a retro motorcycle. Chances are, he would most
            probably draw a silhouette close to the Royal Enfield Classic 350.
            Talk about establishing an image&hellip; or asserting dominance.
            Despite being served in the same old bottle, the Classic remains an
            intoxicating offering to this day but now, there are new wines in
            town. Some are trying to imitate the legacy quotient of the Classic
            while others serving it in a carafe. Joining the RE Classic 350 in
            this modern-retro warfare is the Yezdi Roadster and Hero&rsquo;s
            Mavrick 440.
          </p>
          <p>
            Standing next to the Classic 350, the Mavrick looks like an
            impostor. A bad one at that. The reason being RE&rsquo;s authentic
            retro styling. Despite looking the same since the time it was
            conceived, it has been raining Classics for more than two decades. A
            huge feat? You bet! The Classic is honoured with the tag of reviving
            Royal Enfield in modern times. The rest is history&hellip; and
            present. Several accolades have been sung for the Classic&rsquo;s
            design and during this comparison test as well, it stood like an
            emperor. Unfazed by the competition. The chrome detailing splattered
            across, accompanied by elements that are bona fide retro, make the
            Classic look like a museum on wheels. RE made huge strides in the
            build quality department while debuting the J platform with the
            Meteor 350. The Classic 350 might look the same but all the body
            panels are new and it shows!
          </p>
          <p>
            In terms of retro appearance, it&rsquo;s the Yezdi Roadster that
            comes closer to the Classic than the Mavrick. We wanted to get the
            Jawa 350 for the test since it would have rivaled the Classic
            aesthetically better than the Roadster but we aren&rsquo;t
            complaining. Classic Legends did face some hurdles during its
            initial years of operation, particularly because their motorcycles
            felt like they had been built in a barn. Not anymore though because
            the Roadster feels much better than before, to look at and the way
            it feels as well. Tiny round LED headlamp, twin peashooter exhaust
            and a droplet shaped fuel tank with nicely carved knee recesses are
            some of the highlights. The Mavrick however, finds itself at the far
            end of the spectrum because the only retro bit on the Mavrick is the
            round LED headlamp. Apart from that, it looks like a modern
            motorcycle through and through. Albeit a bit bland in our opinion.
            While the Roadster and the Classic look a bit more special than
            other sets of wheels plowing on our streets, the Mavrick refuses to
            stand out.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is hard to fault most of the modern motorcycles in terms of build
            quality and we suffered the same fate because all the three
            motorcycles here, feel at par with each other and it all comes down
            to personal preferences. For instance, I, personally, am not a huge
            fan of RE&rsquo;s modern switchgear. Yes, it is indeed a unique
            layout but I would prefer function over form any day. Where the RE
            trumps the other two motorcycles is the cockpit view which is as
            gorgeous as it can be, thanks to the retainment of analogue dials.
            It can also be specced with RE&rsquo;s tripper navigation pod. On
            the other hand, both the Mavrick and the Roadster get a negative LCD
            instrument cluster. How can we expect it to have a positive impact
            on the rider when the name itself is negative? Both the displays
            suffer from blindness under bright sunlight with the
            Roadster&rsquo;s looking like a black piece of bezel. The Roadster
            also misses out on bluetooth connectivity while the Mavrick has it,
            accompanied by turn-by-turn navigation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although looks are entirely subjective, most of us agreed that the
            Roadster drifts away from the Classic and the Mavrick, establishing
            itself as the motorcycle which is bound to turn more heads. There
            are simply too many Classics on the roads and the Mavrick? Too
            simple. Moreover, it also has a &lsquo;since 1969&rsquo; sticker
            plastered on the side panel. Nice? Niceee. The Roadster has a sort
            of reckless abandon associated with it and it works in its favour.
            The same philosophy is reflected in the way you sit on the
            motorcycle with the Roadster feeling the most unique of the lot. Its
            handlebar is tilted towards the rider and with its mid-set footpegs,
            it results in a rider&rsquo;s triangle that is as unique as the
            motorcycle looks. The Roadster feels a bit weird at first. On the
            other hand, the Mavrick feels like home. It feels like a motorcycle
            that you&rsquo;ve owned for the past several years. This was
            accomplished by a wide handlebar that is more &lsquo;normal&rsquo;
            as compared to the Roadster or the Classic for that matter. And
            also, the footpegs aren&rsquo;t too far behind. The Classic? You sit
            on it like you sit on a chair. Whether that&rsquo;s a good thing or
            bad, that depends on the involvement that you&rsquo;re seeking from
            your motorcycle.
          </p>
          <p>
            Their spec sheets dictate that they have the same genre of
            motorcycling in mind. Clocking fast lap times? Look elsewhere.
            Calling forth a dust storm on trails? Who are we kidding! Saying
            that these motorcycles are meant to go slow, would be slightly
            demeaning to them because they&rsquo;re decently fast. However,
            these motorcycles egg you on to adopt a laidback lifestyle. Not the
            Roadster though but we will come to that later. The Classic, as
            authoritative as it looks, its mindset is even more rock-solid. It
            doesn&rsquo;t mind going a little faster, but it LOVES going slow.
            The new 349cc, single-cylinder thumper is devoid of vibrations and
            turned out to be the smoothest of the lot. Us being enthusiasts at
            heart, we discredited the Classic and ditched it for the Mavrick and
            the Roadster when two of us went on a joyride. However, piloting the
            Classic made it clear - it is indeed a special motorcycle. It is
            devoid of any top end surge because all the ponies and thrust are
            concealed within the low and mid range. The thump at slower speeds
            has propelled the Classic to the status of a cult motorcycle and we
            can see why. The engine is a beautiful experience which makes you
            forget all the other aspects of motorcycling. It doesn&rsquo;t mind
            cruising at 90kmph all day long but after crossing the triple digit
            mark, the progression is slow, if not lethargic like earlier. Smooth
            and precise gearshifts add to its old-school charm. It is a no
            nonsense motorcycle when it comes to how the engine behaves. Its job
            is to instill emotions in the rider which are nonchalant and it
            excels in doing that. However, if speed is your best friend then the
            Classic would turn out to be a nemesis. Wringing the throttle
            doesn&rsquo;t result in protest but it won&rsquo;t make you grin in
            the process.
          </p>
          <p>
            I might receive some flak for saying this but if you consider just
            the engine architecture and how it makes the rider feel, I believe
            that the Mavrick is the better thumper than the Classic. Its engine,
            which is shared with the H-D X440, might not be as smooth as the
            Classic but has oodles of character. It makes you feel all the
            things that you expect from the Classic but in a slightly amplified
            manner. The Mavrick turned out to be much faster than the Classic
            and certainly more comfortable doing triple digit speeds. The sixth
            cog, which is absent in the Classic, works like an overdrive gear in
            the Mavrick. It doesn&rsquo;t have that much juice in the sixth
            gear, restricting its use to highway duties alone. The Mavrick
            thumps to life with a deeper exhaust note than the Classic. The dug
            dug is Classic&rsquo;s forte but the Mavrick also has a good
            soundtrack to go along with it. Cruising at 100kmph is a breeze for
            the Mavrick, lending it better touring credentials as compared to
            the Classic 350. Even at those speeds, it has enough grunt left in
            its thumping heart to breeze past other vehicles. It might not be as
            smooth as the Classic but in its own right, the Mavrick is mostly
            vibe-free. We found the transmission to be the best of the lot with
            just the right amount of tactile feedback communicated to the
            rider&rsquo;s feet.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Yezdi Roadster still feels like a custom-built motorcycle by a
            few nutjobs who wanted to build a retro motorcycle but with a
            high-revving engine. By custom-built, we don&rsquo;t mean it in a
            bad way because it was the Roadster which plastered a silly grin on
            our faces. The other two made us smile while the Roadster made us
            laugh. It is hungry for revs and doesn&rsquo;t possess the magical
            low end grunt of the Mavrick and Classic but its mid range is at par
            with its rivals. Where it trumps the other two is the sense of
            involvement. While the other two motorcycles are stoned hippies, it
            feels the Roadster relied on synthetic recreational sources. It has
            a high-revving engine which rewards as much as you&rsquo;re generous
            with the throttle. Classic Legends have made some crucial changes to
            its powerplant and it shows. In the presence of the Mavrick and the
            Classic, the Roadster still feels a little raw. There are more
            vibrations than the other two motorcycles but now, they seem like
            its character as they&rsquo;re not as bothersome as they used to be
            earlier. Apart from a deaf or an irrational person, no one dislikes
            some aural drama and if that&rsquo;s what you seek, the Roadster
            will impress with its twin peashooter exhaust. A retro motorcycle
            with a sprightly engine and exhausts that let out pops and crackles?
            The Roadster is certainly eccentric and we loved it for that.
          </p>
          <p>
            Their rest of the body follows the same path as their beating heart.
            On its feet, the Classic 350 justifies why Bajaj called it an
            elephant. Although indirectly, the tag definitely reflects
            Classic&#39;s on road demeanours. Its sheer weight can be felt at
            all times. Not to the extent that it comes off as a scary motorcycle
            to live with but riding it back to back with the other two
            motorcycles established that the Classic is a moving piece of
            concrete. Every cycle part that has been utilized here, has been
            tuned keeping in mind that the rider would want to go slow. Out of
            the trio, it is the least reactive to rider&rsquo;s inputs. Looking
            for a good horror show with jumpscares? Tip the Classic into a
            corner as aggressively as you can. It will get you to the other end
            but with soiled pants. It might not be as dynamically capable as the
            other two but the suspension setup makes easy work of all the
            undulations that we so frequently find on our roads. The Classic has
            the best ride quality out of the three as it glides over potholes.
            Another reason why you would want to &lsquo;glide&rsquo; over
            potholes is because bringing the Classic to a screeching halt is
            another experience. Sort of scary because the brakes have absolutely
            no feedback, apart from feeling woodden as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Roadster again stood out in terms of riding dynamics because it
            has the stiffest suspension setup out of the lot. While it
            won&rsquo;t throw the rider to a different dimension while
            encountering undulations, the Mavrick certainly feels more composed
            than the Roadster and the Classic? Definitely more comfortable than
            the Roadster. It instills more confidence while cornering as
            compared to the Classic but still, something felt off. Not with the
            motorcycle mechanically but the way it behaves in the real world.
            The awkward rider&rsquo;s triangle adds to this feeling. The
            Roadster still feels a lot more manageable and flickable around
            bends as compared to the Classic. The same can also be said about
            its braking department which is not as potent or communicative as
            the Mavrick but it won&rsquo;t put you off with unnecessary
            jumpscares.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lately, Hero has struck gold when it comes to riding dynamics
            because even when it comes to the Mavrick, it struck the perfect
            balance between involvement and ride quality. So much so that it
            just outshines the competition while becoming the gold standard. Its
            17-inch wheels at both ends lend it naked-streetfighter-like agility
            while the suspension setup makes easy work of undulations. It feels
            supple over bumps while also doubling up as an enabler if you wish
            to have some fun around bends. Even the braking department bestows
            confidence to go faster and faster with ample feedback and bite.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the end of one fine day of riding these beauties back to back, it
            couldn&rsquo;t have been more clear that if someone wants to buy an
            authentically retro motorcycle, they will certainly knock at
            RE&rsquo;s dealerships. Not anywhere else. Many have tried
            replicating its old-school formula and all of them failed. If
            someone wants a Classic 350, they will get the Classic 350. The
            Classic has crushed its competition by asserting dominance you would
            expect from an emperor. It still stands its ground undaunted and we
            can see why. Then there&rsquo;s the Yezdi Roadster which would
            appeal to enthusiasts out there who wish to own a retro beauty, sans
            the laziness that comes with it. It has oodles of character to keep
            you smiling ear to ear. For sh*ts and giggles, the Roadster is the
            way to go. However, for an everyday motorcyclist who&rsquo;s seeking
            pure motorcycling, the Hero Mavrick presents itself as the strongest
            contender. Its biggest and only fault being its simple looks. If you
            can look past that, it weaves the magic of the Classic 350 and
            involvement of the Roadster together, to compose a spell which is
            bound to enchant most of the motorcyclists out there.
