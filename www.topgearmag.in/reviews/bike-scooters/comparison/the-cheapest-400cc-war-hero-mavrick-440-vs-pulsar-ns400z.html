            Now, let us begin with the Pulsar NS 400Z. Firstly, It is the clear
            winner of the two. Let&#39;s get that out of the way. But there are
            good reasons for that. It is cheaper to begin with, weighs less, is
            faster, and is also comfortable enough that one can go long
            distances in it.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            But is there more to it than meets the eye? I really don&rsquo;t
            think so. You see the Hero Mavrick doesn&rsquo;t look like anything
            like any offerings from the Hero stables as the NS 400Z does. But it
            doesn&rsquo;t look that stand-out as well if I&rsquo;m being honest.
            The overall design of the Mavrick looks bland, especially from the
            rear. And here is where the NS 400Z makes an interesting argument.
            Yes, this looks like an NS. I mean apart from the headlight, it will
            look quite similar. However, it doesn&rsquo;t look bad at all. It
            doesn&rsquo;t look incomplete but rather has a powerful stance. And
            Bajaj hopes that it is enough to sway the people to their side. And
            honestly, it works.
          </p>
          <p>
            From any other context, there are no possible places where the
            Mavrick has enough attributes that can pull you to it. More relaxed
            stance I guess? But has the NS even complained about being
            uncomfortable? So why not compromise on the relaxed stance, for more
            horsepower, grunt, and a slightly aggressive stance?&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Other than that, the NS 400Z can do everything that the Mavrick can,
            but the Mavrick can&#39;t say the same for itself. And that is the
            sole reason why it is the winner of the comparison.&nbsp;
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="tab-content" id="tab-content-4" style="display: none">
          <p>
            Let me reiterate the point that I have made earlier in a slightly
            different way. If you were to see these two motorcycles together,
            the NS 400Z is probably what will get your attention even though it
            looks almost like the NS 200.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now here is why. The Hero Mavrick is a cruiser. It has retro
            elements that it has to cater to as it goes up against other retro
            motorcycles, but at the same time, it has to look modern to give
            itself some edge. I am guessing the design team got stuck somewhere
            in the middle and the result is not that interesting.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Now when you move to the NS 400Z, the stance itself is quite
            aggressive to look at and the differentiating headlights are unique.
            Yes, the styling is not that different. But it is not that bad
            either. And anyway, you will have a lot more fun riding it, than
            looking at it from the side. More on that later.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Speaking of the features, both motorcycles get Turn by Turn
            navigation in the instrument cluster with an LCD. Although it looks
            better in the Mavrick, the rest of the instrument cluster is far
            better on the Pulsar. It is bigger, sharper and has a lot more
            colours. It is truly amazing how much more you get from a motorcycle
            that is cheaper than its competitor.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Now let us come down to the electronics package. The Hero Mavrick
            has nothing. It is just a motorcycle to switch on and ride it to
            your heart&rsquo;s content. In the case of the NS 400Z, you will
            find quite a lot to play with. Four different riding modes, Traction
            Control settings, and the power to switch your main headlights on
            and off&hellip; I mean it is fun to see so many settings to play
            with on a motorcycle that costs below two lakhs. What you might find
            in the feature list of the Hero Mavrick is the SOS button. That
            button doesn&rsquo;t connect you to anyone from Hero. Rather all it
            does is send a text to a contact that you have saved on your Hero
            app. Now depends on how much the saved contact loves you or is
            vigilant, that will dictate the response to your SOS help button. To
            be honest, it is a bit useless and a half-thought idea.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            In this case as well, the Pulsar NS 400Z takes away the win.&nbsp;

          <p>
            Let me summarise this section in short before I dive into it. The
            Pulsar NS 400Z can do whatever the Hero Mavrick can think of doing,
            but the Mavrick doesn&rsquo;t reciprocate that.
          </p>
          <p>
            The NS 400Z is a nimble and agile motorcycle. With a shorter
            wheelbase than the NS 200 (by about 12mm), weighing barely anything
            more than the NS 200, and beefy front USDs, the riding experience on
            the NS 400Z is on a different planet altogether. Compare that to the
            bulky Mavrick and if you ride them side by side, there is no reason
            on this god-gifted earth that you would choose the Hero. And the
            difference becomes ever so more evident once you start pushing the
            vehicles.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            The engine on the NS 400Z is so strong. 39.4 BHP on the 400Z to 27
            BHP on the Mavrick. I mean is there even a comparison? The low-end
            torque delivery on the Mavrick is a lot better no doubt, you can
            only reap the benefits of that in off-roading conditions, honestly.
            Rest in under no conditions will you feel that the Pulsar engine is
            lacking anywhere. This is a tested engine after all. It has served
            the Dominar very well and now it has to move less weight around in
            the NS 400Z. A lot less weight. And did we mention how loud this
            thing is? Wow, the thumps of the Mavrick can be forgotten in an
            instant after you hear the roar that the NS produces. Vehicles will
            move away from your direction and cops will think you have a custom
            exhaust on an NS 200. I was genuinely scared that I would be stopped
            by the cops for having this exhaust, but boy oh boy, I would have
            the biggest grin on my face. Power is available on tap on the NS and
            the bulk of the power hides in the higher rpms, while the Mavrick
            caters to the lower rpm torque delivery. But it is not enough to
            outshine the gruntier NS here. Vibrations on the NS are higher, but
            what the hell! Vibrations make you feel alive in my opinion.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Now in terms of riding dynamics, the NS 400Z is far superior. I mean
            yes, it will be easier to cruise on the Mavrick and offroading will
            also be a lot more comfortable. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that the
            NS 400Z can&rsquo;t do it. It will be a little challenging, but it
            is more than capable of handling cruising or off-roading. I mean
            this has an off-road mode for crying out loud! (doesn&rsquo;t make
            that much of a difference). And when it comes to other aspects, the
            NS 400Z just steals the show. Be it straight-line speed, cornering
            capabilities, stopping power, hooliganism, or even stunting
            capabilities, the NS 400Z just steals the show. Its front end is
            very reassuring, the rear is also stable, and it is sooo flickable.
            City riding will be easy as hell. It is a motorcycle capable enough
            to make you forget what petrol prices are.
          </p>
          <p>
            The only thing where it lacks is when you have to make a U-Turn, its
            turning radius will not help you at all. However, that is when you
            do the burnout and whip the rear around&hellip; Just Kidding.&nbsp;
