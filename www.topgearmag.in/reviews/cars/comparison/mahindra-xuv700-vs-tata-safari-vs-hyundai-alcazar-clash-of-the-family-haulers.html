            <span style="font-weight: 400"
              >So you need an SUV with 6-7 seats to act as the family runabout,
              and because you care about the way it looks and has all the
              modern-day creature comforts, it needs to stylishly
              feature-packed. </span
            ><span style="font-weight: 400"
              >It also needs to shout about that fact, because what&rsquo;s the
              point in doing something different if your neighbours don&rsquo;t
              notice it. Oh, and it needs to be economical and cheaper to buy
              than the most-loved MPV options because to accept a compromise on
              last row practicality you&rsquo;re going to have to really love
              the other stuff.</span
            >

          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 400"
              >For the face-off, we have three particularly fine examples: the
              newest XUV700, the legendary Tata Safari and the Hyundai Alcazar.
              And before anyone gets too excited, the cars in pictures with
              their respective specifications do not compete directly (the
              XUV700 and the Safari being diesel with auto transmissions and the
              Alcazar being a petrol manual), but are here to represent the
              practicalities rather than pure performance. Thus the spec-off has
              been done with the Hyundai in diesel guise for more
              relevance.</span

          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 400"
              >First up, the XUV700. It&rsquo;s the newest in this trio, bigger
              and better in every way than the previous XUV500 that existed. It
              does not skimp on making its presence felt with those extra-large
              headlamp units, and some quirky details such as the new logo and
              flushed door handles. It feels the most youthful of the lot, fully
              in charge of the daily 9-5 executed in style, yet finding time out
              for the late-night club-hopping with friends. Imagine casual
              formals. More like Polo Shirts with Chinos.&nbsp;</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 400"
              >It&rsquo;s a full seven-seater, with a bench seat configuration
              in the middle row, and there is plenty of space. With 5 seats
              operational, you do get 450+ litres of boot space, but official
              figures are still awaited from Mahindra. The rearmost seats are a
              little upright, but you can get small-sized adults in there if you
              slide the middle seats forward, and the fold &rsquo;n&rsquo;
              tumble action for the middle row is easier than on the bench-seat
              version of the Safari.</span

          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 400"
              >The Alcazar is an easy, friendly and more family-like character.
              It sits much lower and feels the least imposing compared to the
              other two, but has the longest wheelbase of the lot. It&rsquo;s
              technically a 5+2 in 7 seater guise, but that extended wheelbase
              translates to better boot space with all rows up &ndash; a
              meaningful 180 litres of it. It&rsquo;s got the most bling to
              spice up any corporate environment with gunmetal accents
              everywhere. It&rsquo;s smart, easy-going nature is what will
              attract you, more like proper formals or a 3 piece well-fitted
              suit that&rsquo;s desirable and a reliable choice.</span

            <span style="font-weight: 400"
              >Parked amongst this trio, the Safari feels the most
              adventure-seeking and intimidating given its muscular stance.
              It&rsquo;s aged beautifully with </span
            ><span style="font-weight: 400"
              >that split headlamp set-up shared with the 5-seat Harrier, but it
              has aged. The Safari&rsquo;s stepped roof, roof rails and upright
              tail do really help it stand out given its actually no larger than
              the XUV700. </span
            ><span style="font-weight: 400"
              >With its go-anywhere, do-whatever attitude, it sure is made for
              things you&rsquo;d hardly do on weekdays. Imagine wearing cargo
              pants with a leather jacket and taking a detour over terrain you
              normally wouldn&rsquo;t set your eyes upon.<br />

            <span style="font-weight: 400"
              >We sampled the XUV&rsquo;s most powerful powertrain version
              &ndash; the 2.2-litre diesel with 185hp and 450Nm of torque.
              Frankly, these are segment busting stats! The Tata Safari&rsquo;s
              2.0-litre diesel engine with its 6-speed auto transmission
              churning out 170hp and 350Nm pales in comparison despite being
              slightly lower on paper. And the differences are more apparent
              once on the move. Where the Safari bumbles and grumbles to begin
              with before gradually building speed and transmitting that power
              on the tarmac, the XUV feels sprightly and peppy, in a way you
              just wouldn&rsquo;t expect an SUV in this category to be.</span

          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 400"
              >The XUV felt significantly quicker in kick-down acceleration and
              hits 100kmph in the 10-sec band plus gets 3 drive modes (Zip, Zap,
              Zoom) to explore all of the engine&rsquo;s capabilities.</span

          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 400"
              >The 6-speed auto on both front-wheel drive cars works with great
              smoothness. Both the diesel units do sound gravelly but refinement
              is far superior on the XUV.</span

          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 400"
              >But if it&rsquo;s the ultimate refinement you desire, we had the
              petrol-powered 2.0 litre, Alcazar, to give us perspective. It felt
              light, refined and most relaxed to drive, easy turn-ins at city
              speeds with the most well-controlled body movement. Though power
              figures when compared are significantly lower, the Alcazar is also
              400 kg lighter than the Safari in this test. The diesel options
              for the Alcazar though are a whole league down on displacement and
              power in this group.</span

          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 400"
              >Let&rsquo;s be honest here, people buy large family haulers
              because of the extra luggage space, extra seats and all the
              practicality that comes built-in. But of late, they have started
              to expect the finer things in these pseudo front-wheel driven
              SUV&rsquo;s &ndash; finesse, refinement, digital cockpits and
              ambient lighting while foregoing the best third-row seats or the
              largest boot.&nbsp;</span

          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 400"
              >And for that very argument, you will be hard-pressed to find
              faults on an otherwise brilliant wholesome package called the
              XUV700. It&rsquo;s the most plush inside, loaded with tech and
              features, has the best power plant, and feels sophisticated while
              being easy to live with. The Alcazar comes close to this feeling
              with the added dose of Hyundai&rsquo;s service and reliability
              trump card, but space-wise and engine specs-wise, it does feel the
              David amongst the goliaths here.</span

          <p>

              seems to be playing catch up to the other two. It does exude
              toughness with a better sense of space in the third row, but with
              my argument above it is a choice that is hardly easy to make in
              this company.</span

              &ndash; the Alcazar. It&rsquo;s the easiest to get in, and feels
              the most luxurious here (never thought I&rsquo;d say that for a
              Hyundai!). And this is really down to the two-tone interior with
              mocha brown leather trim, gloss black finished surfaces and just
              the right soft cushioning on the seats with a great sinking in
              vibe.</span

              digital customizable instrument cluster. The second row of seats
              could have been more spacious, lack side lateral cushioning on the
              ends of the 7 seat bench on test, but do offer a recline function.
              But a glaring omission was missing cupholders in the centre
              armrest for on-the-go coffee lovers like me! Regarding the third
              row seating, best left to kids or adults you&rsquo;re less fond

              You&rsquo;re greeted with a plush white interior trim, a really
              wide slab of black glass in the form of a twin-screen setup,
              powered driver seats with controls on the driver&rsquo;s door pad
              &ndash; straight off from the latest Mercedes SUV lineup.</span

              >The seating position is nice and high-set, with good ergonomics
              and most controls within easy reach. The seat cushioning is
              accommodating for plus-sized adults too but you will be nudged
              around while attempting some high-speed cornering. The second row
              of seats are comfortably firm, with a great sense of space aided
              by the panoramic sunroof. The left rear passenger also gets the
              boss button to move the front passenger seat out of the way to
              increase legroom. The third row is the most comfortable in this
              group, but not in the league of a traditional 7 seater MPV.</span

            <span style="font-weight: 400"
              >The Tata Safari, for the larger than life-size and imposing
              stance, the interior is starting to look dated. The sea of black
              on the top level of dash trim seems more hard-wearing and even
              though it is the roomiest of the lot, ingress and egress is not
              the easiest unlike the other two. The second-row captain seats are
              large and firm, but the under-thigh support is on the firmer side
              which can be a tad uncomfortable on long journeys. Ingress to the
              last row is relatively easier thanks to the space between the
              captain seats, but once seated comfort and space is at a premium
              for average-sized adults.</span

              >The XUV700 and the Alcazar trump on the technology and features
              warfront with the Mahindra boasting of segment-leading ADAS safety
              functions, and more active safety features than many cars or
              SUV&rsquo;s in this class. The digital instrument screens are also
              crisp and easy to navigate but we did miss some useful everyday
              options like ventilated seats, rear sun-blinds and an auto-dimming
              mirror. Hyundai was always at the forefront to pack as many
              comfort features in its cars, and the Alcazar doesn&rsquo;t
              disappoint. It only really misses out on the ADAS safety
              technology in this trio. The Safari plays the modern co-existing
              with convention card with its part digital instrument cluster,
              smallish but super bright infotainment screen, hard-wearing
              plastics and controls while missing out on 360-degree parking
              cams, blind view mirrors, dual-zone climate control and any ADAS
              functions in this test.</span

              >The XUV700 has some quirky details but what you will not argue
              about is its simplified and more mature organic design language
              inspired by the outgoing XUV500. The new M Logo which may seem a W
              is the most prominent change, and will take some time getting used
              to. The large C-shaped sharp headlights have a peculiar design,
              but on the road will catch your attention. The overall silhouette
              is almost identical to the XUV500, but the flushed door handles
              and creases flowing across the body-line gives it a cleaner and
              sharper appeal. The rear feels plain Jane with some plasticky cuts
              and creases and the sequential turn indicators do feel
              upmarket.</span

              >Moving on to the Alcazar, let&rsquo;s just call it a stretched
              Creta in a crispier outfit. The gunmetal chrome accents all around
              give it a premium look and to some, it ends up looking more
              expensive than the other two. The added third row gives it the
              longest wheelbase in this trio. The alloy wheels choice and the
              all-LED headlights work well, though the rear design of the car
              leaves a little to be desired, but sure looks more corporate and
              family-friendly at the same time.</span

              It&rsquo;s gigantic and means business. It&rsquo;s smart looking
              and subtly at the same time. The overall silhouette is an elegant
              one, the Discovery Sport DNA held within its Indian soul &ndash;
              ever-ready to pounce on the road and eat up as much tarmac and
