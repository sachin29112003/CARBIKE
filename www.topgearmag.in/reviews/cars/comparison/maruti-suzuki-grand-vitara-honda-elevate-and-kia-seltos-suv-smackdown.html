            What did one Japanese SUV say to another? &lsquo;Hey there, are you
            a hybrid? Because you&rsquo;ve been giving me some serious electric
            competition.&rsquo;
          </p>
          <p>
            I chuckled at the joke, but it dawned on me that many wouldn&rsquo;t
            get it. Why? Because there are few takers for strong hybrid
            technology, and despite their impressive fuel efficiency, these SUVs
            are still far from mass acceptance. Not many users fully grasp the
            benefits on offer, which is why a staggering 70 percent of Grand
            Vitaras sold are the naturally aspirated four-cylinder variants.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now that we know where the market trends are, let&rsquo;s talk about
            how you can spend your money more wisely. Am I already suggesting
            that the Elevate is a superior vehicle? At least in terms of costs,
            yes, to begin with. It&rsquo;s seventy thousand less, and you end up
            with a superior car.
          </p>
          <p>
            Why superior? Because it&rsquo;s a Honda. And sporting that emblem
            upfront sets certain expectations for the Elevate. Quality, fit and
            finish, the materials used, and the engineering behind it
            all&mdash;these are the aspects where the Elevate truly shines.
            Distinguishing between the two is tricky because they&rsquo;re both
            Japanese SUVs, but it&rsquo;s the Honda that truly makes you feel
            special.
          </p>
          <p>
            For starters, it&rsquo;s uncommon. Which means more people notice it
            for longer. And there&rsquo;s plenty to admire&mdash;its flat,
            upright nose gives it an imposing presence. Unlike the Grand
            Vitara&rsquo;s stretched length (which seems to be trying too hard
            to hide its Brezza-inspired proportions), the Elevate appears more
            proportionate. Its headlamps adhere to the conventional setup,
            eschewing the split arrangement, which lends the Elevate a much more
            mature face.
          </p>
          <p>
            While both vie for attention with their connected rear LED lamps,
            it&rsquo;s the Grand Vitara that catches the eye with its more
            appealing rear. Yet, pop open the hatch, and you&rsquo;ll quickly
            realize that the Elevate&rsquo;s boot space is significantly more
            generous, practical, and usable.
          </p>
          <p>
            The interior approach is distinct for both, making it relatively
            easy to choose between the two. Grand Vitara opts for a safe design
            theme, featuring a cascading central console housing manual air con
            buttons. The screen is perched atop the dashboard, complemented by
            two analog dials I adore. However, the screen quality leaves
            something to be desired, and the 360-degree camera output lacks
            sharpness. Soft-touch materials and layers don&rsquo;t snugly align
            with the underlying plastic. Our test car also exhibited faulty
            aircon vents, and the power window switches felt subpar in terms of
            quality and longevity.
          </p>
          <p>
            In contrast, the Elevate employs a dual-tone interior theme, exuding
            an executive aura. The cabin execution feels modern, accentuated by
            a horizontally set screen that exudes superiority. The aircon
            controls offer delightful click-feedback, adding a touch of
            character. The driver benefits from better tech, including a crisp
            screen doubling as an analog meter. From a distance, it mirrors the
            Grand Vitara&rsquo;s elegance, but up close, its modern
            sophistication becomes apparent. Notably, Honda&rsquo;s startup
            animation on the central screen adds a unique touch, subtly
            signifying elevation in life.
          </p>
          <p>
            The same sense of refinement extends to the rear seats. Unlike the
            Grand Vitara, getting in and out feels more elegant and natural,
            although the door screws could be better concealed. Once settled,
            the rear bench impresses with its flat, supportive, wide design and
            optimal seat angle, akin to a comfortable couch.
          </p>
          <p>
            Enhancing the experience further is the Elevate&rsquo;s suspension
            setup. While it thuds audibly over sharp potholes, it excels in
            other terrains &ndash; highways, undulating roads, broken paths
            &ndash; instilling confidence whether you&rsquo;re sitting in the
            front or rear. The Elevate&rsquo;s drive experience is notably
            superior too. Its i-VTEC 1.5-liter naturally aspirated engine
            delivers instant power, granting access to the band&rsquo;s meat
            earlier than expected. Surprisingly, the Honda surpasses even the
            K-series engine in terms of freedom. Honda pairs its high-revving
            engines with CVT transmissions, appreciated widely for their smooth
            and effortless driving experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite the rubber band effect inherent in CVTs, the Elevate&rsquo;s
            linear acceleration masks the shift delay effectively. Considering
            most SUV drivers adopt a sedate driving style, the Elevate presents
            itself as the smoother, more refined powertrain choice.
          </p>
          <p>
            The standout advantage of choosing the Honda lies in its advanced
            suite of driver assistance aids. Utilizing cutting-edge camera-based
            sensors, these features provide an extra layer of safety, including
            blind spot monitors, auto high beam, lane centering, and adaptive
            cruise control with start-stop functionality. While not all of these
            features might come into play daily, several prove invaluable during
            city drives. Moreover, certain functionalities are best reserved for
            when you venture outside the city in your Elevate, ensuring a
            heightened sense of security and convenience wherever your journey
            takes you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet, the Elevate remains underappreciated. It&rsquo;s a Honda
            available at a lower price than a Maruti Suzuki, making it
            exceptionally appealing and desirable. Like all Hondas, it holds the
            potential to build a legacy over a decade, much like its legendary
            predecessors. Want to be part of this legacy? A test drive of the
            Elevate might just convince you.
          </p>
          <p>
            And while you&rsquo;re at it, I strongly recommend a visit to the
            Kia dealership to explore a captivating variant of the Seltos. Yes,
            it comes at a premium of around a lakh and twenty thousand over the
            Grand Vitara, and by no means is that a trivial amount. But consider
            the benefits. A turbocharged petrol engine! A cabin that surpasses
            both the Grand Vitara and the Elevate, and a transmission that
            offers the best of all worlds (once you adjust your driving style to
            it).
          </p>
          <p>
            Let me break it down for you. I&rsquo;ve just illustrated why
            investing in the Elevate over the Grand Vitara is a wise choice.
            However, I don&rsquo;t wholeheartedly endorse the Elevate because it
            excels as a weekday car, not a weekend thrill. Enter the Seltos. Its
            new 1.5-liter turbocharged engine packs significantly more power
            than the naturally aspirated units we discussed, making it a joy to
            zip around in, especially when you venture beyond the city limits.
          </p>
          <p>
            I opted for the clutch-less manual from the lot, or what Kia dubs an
            intelligent manual transmission. Why? Because it isn&rsquo;t a
            traditional manual transmission in every sense, allowing your left
            leg some respite. Just slide the right gear, a process that comes
            with its perks. You remain in complete control of the power
            delivery, and when not needed, you can shift to neutral for optimal
            efficiency.
          </p>
          <p>
            If these mechanical nuances don&rsquo;t sway you, let&rsquo;s dive
            into the Seltos&rsquo; cabin. Every surface is impeccably finished,
            whether&nbsp;it&rsquo;s the hard plastics or the soft-touch
            materials. Not only is the infotainment screen superior to the
            Elevate&rsquo;s, but it&rsquo;s also more user-friendly and
            positioned lower, enhancing visibility outside the windshield. Then
            there&rsquo;s the driver screen, offering a plethora of cockpit
            options tailored to your desires.
          </p>
          <p>
            Features? Abundant. Ventilated seats, driving modes, enhanced sound
            system, and integrated sunblinds for rear passengers. Outside, there
            are sequential turn indicators and intricately detailed illumination
            units. The cabin is meticulously assembled &ndash; tighter panel
            gaps, superior quality, everything suggests longevity, surpassing
            both Honda and Maruti Suzuki.
          </p>
          <p>
            The driving experience is sophisticated, slightly on the plush side,
            making the Elevate the better choice. Still, for city driving where
            the Elevate can be jarring, the Seltos ensures a far more
            comfortable ride. With a full load, the Seltos squats noticeably
            more than the Elevate, but honestly, how often do you drive with a
            car full of passengers? (If you do, perhaps consider a mid-spec
            Scorpio-N for the same budget.)
          </p>
          <p>
            The Seltos T-GDi iMT offers an option that could elevate your
            driving experience a bit further than what the Elevate offers.
            I&rsquo;ve always believed there are many vehicles that can make
            your weekdays enjoyable, but only a few that truly enhance your
            weekend. If you share this belief, the Seltos deserves the top spot
            on your consideration list.
