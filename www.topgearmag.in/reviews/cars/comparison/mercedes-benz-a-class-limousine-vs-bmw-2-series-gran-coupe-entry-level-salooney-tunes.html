            This one is going to be hard, perhaps harder given our affection for
            luxury and SUVs. The wars between the German behemoths have been
            raging for a long time, and with the pair&rsquo;s latest and
            smallest four-door sedans, they appear to have started at the bottom
            end of the luxury car owners club.
          </p>
          <p>
            The new A-Class Limousine is Mercedes-Benz&rsquo;s second aim at an
            entry-level sedan, and this time it hits closer to the mark with its
            wow dash design, roomy interior (over the old CLA that it replaces
            in our market) and smart connectivity options expected of a 2021
            generation car. We&rsquo;re driving the petrol-powered A200
            representing the entry point to the range that consists of just one
            fully loaded trim.
          </p>
          <p>
            The BMW 2 Gran Coupe on the other hand in most markets is a rival to
            the Mercedes CLA, which means in this test, it should zoom past the
            A-Limo in the style and driving contest. The 220i we have here as is
            the A200 are both petrol-powered 4 cyl saloons mated to 7-speed
            dual-clutch automatic gearboxes, albeit in FWD formats &ndash; a
            trade-off for packaging size vs space, efficiency and price.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both are very alluring to impress a first-time luxury car buyer with
            interiors borrowed from their larger siblings, large touch-screen
            entertainment consoles, powered seats and beige-y soft-touch
            materials all around. Each one has a suite of driver modes and
            safety features to make it malleable to all talent levels too.
          </p>
          <p>
            Being a seasoned luxury car driver and a professional, I promise
            I&rsquo;ll reach a verdict. Hopefully without resorting to a coin
            toss!
          </p>
          <h3>
            <strong>Verdict<br /> </strong>
          </h3>
          <p>
            Starting at 37.90 lakhs, the 2 series GC might be the littlest BMW
            four-door in our market, but the air of plush refinement and build
            quality makes it feel bigger than you&rsquo;d expect. Even so,
            it&rsquo;s not averse to some sideways fun if you give it a nudge.
            So if your preference is of pure style with driving dynamics over
            the practicality of a proper 3 box saloon, then you needn&rsquo;t
            look further. As the 2 GC will stand out even in the company of the
            cheapest 330i sportline.
          </p>
          <p>
            But if connectivity, interior layout and badge takes priority over
            driving manners, then the A-Class limousine for many will be
            perfect. It&rsquo;s a great feel-good car that&rsquo;s solid, quiet
            if you don&rsquo;t nail it and safe. You also get an 8-year warranty
            on the engine and transmission, which maybe is Merc&rsquo;s way to
            also justify a sticker price of 39.90 lakhs for a sub 1.4-litre
            petrol engine that may not be the most refined or the most
            economical. But there&rsquo;s more affirmation in the fact, that if
            you buy a Mercedes-Benz, no one will question you.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="tab-content" id="tab-content-2" style="display: none">
          <h3>
            <strong>Front-Driver Compacts</strong>
          </h3>
          <p>
            First things first, the A-Class Limousine is not as sporty to drive
            as its profile suggests. It sits somewhere in between the class in
            terms of dynamics &ndash; not plush enough to feel luxurious, not
            eager enough to be fun &ndash; and thus it lags notably behind the 2
            series GC.
          </p>
          <p>
            The A200 petrol has a boomy-sounding 1.3-litre that also appears in
            Renaults and Nissans, but don&rsquo;t let that put you off. With 161
            bhp on tap, it&rsquo;s&nbsp;more than punchy enough for daily
            driving in the city or the highway, even if it isn&rsquo;t the
            most&nbsp;refined. The 7-speed DCT auto is smooth and attentive most
            of the time too. But it&rsquo;s the road noise and engine noise that
            filters through the cabin that&rsquo;s most underwhelming. Put a
            nice tune on that gorgeous sound system to drown it out a little.
          </p>
          <p>
            And if you&rsquo;re going to be stuck with four-cylinder petrol,
            front-wheel driven car in this class, BMW&rsquo;s is the one to be
            stuck with, and the 220i is a good installation underneath &ndash;
            refined, responsive and with surprisingly honest steering feel. In
            corners, it feels like any real-world FWD thanks to precise
            reactions, and resistance designed to understeer, all coming
            together in a fluid manner. The ride really is sweet, and better
            than the A200, partly because all 2GCs get a real independent back
            axle that eliminates some of the gritty harshnesses felt otherwise.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="tab-content" id="tab-content-3" style="display: none">
          <h3>
            <strong>Lounge Luxury </strong>
          </h3>
          <p>
            And once you step inside the A Class, you realise it&rsquo;s insides
            are not like any other car, especially not in a class like this. The
            dash is a curvaceous piece of bar furniture, with the huge screen
            system on top housing two 10.3in screens &ndash; one as the
            instrument cluster and the other for entertainment and all modern
            connectivity requirements. The centre console&rsquo;s pushed back
            design gives the overall effect of a pared-back luxury lounge rather
            than anything too &lsquo;automotive&rsquo;. At night, illumination
            of strategic interior parts adds a nice theatrical and
            practical&nbsp;note. Some of my friends were simply awed by the
            ambient lighting on the air vents going blue and red when the
            temperature was adjusted lower or higher.
          </p>
          <p>
            General material quality is high, and the big-screens are massively
            impressive for graphics, smooth responses and custom display
            options. It also features the latest MBUX with Mercedes Me connect
            to allow remote information of the car being delivered to your
            smartphone. The seats are a little firm and strangely flat-feeling
            style, and this feeling is compounded once you seat in the 2 GC
            generously side-bolstered seats. But again as in any good Mercedes
            you soon stop noticing them because they&rsquo;re built for
            long-haul&nbsp;support.
          </p>
          <p>
            And this is where the 220i with its grippy MSport steering wheel,
            superb driving position, angled console towards the driver appeals
            to the driving enthusiast in you. The faster rake of the A-pillars
            makes you feel more cocooned inside and this cabin surely has a
            better air of quality build to it over the Mercedes. All versions
            have BMW&rsquo;s touchscreens, but you hardly need to touch it given
            the option of many press-able hard keys around the consoles and the
            iDrive wheel. Yes, we still love it, and it remains the
            industry-best for zooming or scrolling through lists while
            you&rsquo;re on the move.
          </p>
          <p>
            And if you care about life at the back, then the A Class has the
            better sense of space, legroom and headroom compared to the 2
            series. With the beige colour palette and wider rear doors, ingress
            and egress felt better in case you want to carry a small family with
            you, or be chauffeured occasionally. But foot space, often the real
            determinant of back-seat comfort, is pretty tight unless the front
            seats are raised several notches. Under thigh support is a joke a
            comparable to a park bench with a low seating position.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the 2GC legroom isn&rsquo;t at all bad, but anyone anywhere near
            average-man height is going to be wedging their skull into the
            headlining. And the back seat is narrower than the A&rsquo;s but
            definitely felt better on the under-thigh support department for a
            6-footer like me. The 2 GC trumps the A-Class in the boot space
            league with 430 litres of a well-shaped cavern with a concealed
            space saver, compared to the A&rsquo;s 405-litre space with a space
            saver sitting atop.

        <div class="tab-content" id="tab-content-4" style="display: none">
          <h3>
            <strong>Modern Restrained vs Rakish Statement</strong>
          </h3>
          <p>
            With an image of a young, 30-something, rich, style-conscious
            entrepreneur &ndash; one who prefers a sedan that speaks sporty when
            standing still &ndash; you have to start with the 220i in MSport
            trim here. The frameless doors allow a lower roof and clean-looking
            apertures. The front and back look dramatic and racy in the flesh
            especially if you choose that Melbourne Red shade!
          </p>
          <p>
            The side profile adopts almost all the same feature lines as the 8
            Gran Coupe. But while those lines make the 8 look edgier, on the 2
            it makes it look a little flabbier from certain angles. And since
            its architecture is based on BMW&rsquo;s UKL front-wheel platform,
            the 2 GC simply misses out on the pushed back stance of its bigger
            RWD sibling the 3.
          </p>
          <p>
            But if these young something prefer restrained premium and something
            more, errr understated with a star logo, then the A-Class Limo is
            the pick. And it starts up front with the CLS inspired grille and
            lights and a quarter plate sized-three pointed star. The sharp
            looking rear with those slim angular taillights helps it pass off as
            a downsized C-Class.
          </p>
          <p>
            Its an all-new platform, stronger and lighter than before with the
            longest wheelbase in this class (an extravagant 120mm longer). The
            same platform lives under the just launched GLA and the B-Class. The
            A although elegant, fails to appeal on design desirability outside,
            but enter inside, and it&rsquo;s a completely different story
            altogether.
