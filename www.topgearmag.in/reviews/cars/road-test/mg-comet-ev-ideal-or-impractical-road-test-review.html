            Indian buyers have very specific tastes and expectations from their
            prized possessions, and when it comes to automobiles - be it cars or
            bikes, the purchasing drive is helmed by the status alongside the
            need and use case. The mentioned viewpoint might be hard to digest,
            but it is what it is. However, with evolved time, consumers have
            become more aware and conscious of their choices. But does the MG
            Comet spur a value quotient that we Indians are biased for? Does it
            fulfill practical purposes with its unconventional propositions? Or,
            in the most informal tone - is it best as just a toy?&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Verdict</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            You cannot have missed the Comet on the road or its buzz around the
            internet. Ever since it was first showcased in India, people and
            experts have drawn opinions about it from its size and shape. But
            when you drive it, the car rather feels special in some ways and a
            bit ordinary in others. Keep the ordinary part out of the picture
            for a while because it&#39;s already established that at around ten
            lakhs- it is too much to ask for a small car for a developing
            economy like ours. &nbsp;But, in a way, the Comet EV is exceptional
            because of its form factor. The size of the car does add a boon to
            driving it in the city, given how congested our city roads are. But,
            we also have fast roads in our city, where Comet EV sometimes feels
            out of place. The range from the Comet is adequate. However, the
            provision of DC fast charging would have bumped its utility
            quotient. The cities are getting bigger and better, and the charging
            facility is also increasing, so not having a provision for DC
            charging is a bit of a NO for me. However, once the demand is
            promising, MG has promised to bring the fast-charging option to
            Comet. MG Comet is a niche product, making it unconventionally
            unique in itself as it is comparatively expensive to own and
            requires a bit more planning to run as well. Comet&#39;s exterior
            design, interior space management, real-world range, and
            practicality are all undeniable strengths that make it desirable to
            some people, and those some people are more than willing to
            compromise its shortcomings.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="tab-content" id="tab-content-2" style="display: none">
          <p>
            After taking the Comet EV on a test drive involving highway and city
            driving, I was pleased to discover that it achieved a real-world
            efficiency of 11-12 km per kilowatt hour. This translated to an
            actual range of around 190-200 km, which is more than adequate for
            daily use. The battery capacity is 17.3kWh lithium-ion with ferrous
            phosphate chemistry, which is sourced from Tata Autocomp. MG Motor
            has ditched the DC fast charging, and the car can only be charged
            via AC charging. The maximum charging output you can get is by
            installing a 3.3KW Type-2 AC fast charger. And on a standard 3-pin
            15-amp power socket, it took around 9-10 hrs to get it fully
            charged. The car&#39;s lack of support for DC fast charging
            significantly impedes its convenience factor. Take, for example-
            Mumbai boasts a substantial quantity of DC fast chargers, which will
            only continue to grow. The support of DC fast charging could provide
            peace of mind, as it allows flexibility. So, the usability factor is
            limited to someone with a fixed schedule and a predefined route. In
            urban cities with limited space and time, depending on AC charging
            could be a problem.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            The Comet EV gets three driving modes - Eco, Normal and Sport. Eco
            feels a bit dull. However, be it any mode, speeding up the car from
            60-70kmph takes time. It&#39;s still those speeds; the Comet feels
            sportier to drive. The Normal mode is best suited for regular use,
            while the Sport mode provides a bit(not marginal) more exciting
            experience. The Comet EV has three levels of regenerative braking,
            out of which the high level feels too strong, not as strong to get
            the car to complete stop, so one-pedal driving won&#39;t be
            possible. I did stick to the mid-setting for Regen, as it felt like
            the most appropriate option.
          </p>
          <p>
            Comet EV feels zippier to drive, making it even quite fun to put it
            through paces. MG Comet EV weighs 817 kgs, linking it with 42 hp of
            power and 110Nm of electric torque, spinning the rear wheels.
            Numbers might not excite, but the performance is more than adequate
            in the real world. Once you get on to cruising speeds, tyre and
            motor noise are audible. Although you will appreciate its zipper
            performance, once that dulls down, you will find more comfort
            driving the Comet at slow to medium speeds. Because the more you
            gain the speed, the more unstable it will feel.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            I took a Comet EV on a highway run, and just after a few kilometres,
            it felt like a wrong decision. Comet feels quite insecure among the
            numerous cars speeding alongside it. 12-inch wheels, narrow tyres,
            body roll during sharp turns, and its lightweight character make
            Comet a better city slicker rather than a highway relaxation.
            Smaller tyres, along with less suspension travel, do add a bit of a
            discomfiting drive, too - you can feel the suspension work and over
            big potholes - it would quite common to notice suspension bottoming
            out. The steering is so easy to operate and coupled with a turning
            radius of 4.2m - manoeuvrability becomes easy. Tight parking spots,
            narrow, bustling streets - no problem. The visibility is spot on,
            and you sit a bit up, thus giving you a better view of the
            surroundings. The braking setup comes up with a disc at the front
            and drums at the rear, and the bite and feedback from the brakes are
            pretty satisfactory. However, during my drive, I had one instance
            wherein I had to do panic braking, which unsettled the car a bit.

            MG Comet, being made on a dedicated electric platform, liberates a
            decent space on the inside. The battery is placed beneath the floor,
            and the floorboard is flat since there isn&#39;t any transmission
            tunnel.HVAC systems, infotainment, and instrument electronics take
            centre stage, and above and below that is considerable amount of
            space - the glass area is wider. The absence of any partition
            underneath results in a lack of support for the left leg. Moreover,
            there isn&#39;t any storage space apart from two cuppy holes on
            either side of the dashboard and a small dedicated shelf in front of
            the passenger seat. There is decent space in the area of the doors
            for your water bottles and umbrellas. I wish there could be some
            dedicated space near the armrest; I could only manage to keep my
            phone in that space. &nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Plastic quality is great, soft-touch material all around, fit and
            finish of the dashboard and switches are premium. There is a sense
            of techy occasion on the inside, courtesy of a glossy white theme
            along with a two-spoke steering wheel with iPod-like controls. The
            wide glass area and bright white cabin make it feel fresh; however,
            keeping the interiors clean will be a bit of a task. The stains and
            dirt became noticeable within a week of cautious use.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            The door opening is vast, and one can have easy egress and ingress.
            The seating arrangement comfortably accommodates four adults despite
            being constrained by the dimensions. By comfortable, I mean - ideal
            only for short trips and short people. Well, you anyways can ONLY
            take Comet EV on short journeys.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            In terms of storage space, there is barely any place to keep any
            luggage bag. The space is suitable only for charging cables and one
            or two laptop bags. Fold down the 50:50 folding rear seats, and you
            have a decent space to carry your airport baggage.&nbsp;

            Until now, you must already be aware of its tiny dimensions and
            looks. Those who have yet to see it in person should definitely get
            a look at it; it does not matter if you want to buy it or not. Look
            at it in terms of how compact and unconventional the new-age EVs
            could be and how even the tiny mono-volume box on wheels could look
            premium. The MG Comet EV&#39;s implementation of the GSEV platform
            has proven to be a highly effective and economical strategy, which
            has led to a significant improvement in their manufacturing options.
            Wuling Air is a highly promising product in both China and
            Indonesia, and it has been instrumental in driving up the
            company&#39;s sales figures. What &nbsp;MG Hector is to Wuling Almaz
            is the same as what MG Comet EV is to Wuling Air. What works in the
            International market may not necessarily work in India. Although the
            MG Comet EV possesses a distinctive and appealing trait, its form
            factors present notable limitations, which we shall discuss
            later.&nbsp;

            MG Comet is 1.6m tall, similar to around WagonR. But its length and
            width suggest the car is intended for urban driving. The 12-inch
            wheels are at extreme ends, rendering 2.01m of wheelbase, thus
            liberating a bit of generous space considering the length of the
            car. The key looks quite trendy and pocket-friendly, just as you
            would expect from a car of this proposition. The charging port is on
            the front nose of the car. The Comet EV&#39;s lack of a frunk should
            come as no surprise. Rather, it features a modest hood opening
            designed for essential fluid maintenance. LED headlamps,
            long-running DRLs at the front and rear, smartly used chrome, and a
            thin blue line-up on the front make it look stylish and sleek.&nbsp;

            It does not look conventional, and that&#39;s what sets it apart. It
            looks exclusive and modern. However, its tall boy design theme on
            12-inch wheels looks a bit unproportional. But overall, it does
            gather quite a lot of attention. The number of people asking me
            about this car reflects that the car has garnered significant
            attention and excitement from individuals. It was unprecedented that
            people from my residence building visited my abode to inquire about
            a vehicle, a situation that had never previously occurred. The car
            appears distinct, making it an extraordinary addition to
            anyone&#39;s parking.&nbsp;
